Two weeks back I began what I hope will be a series of short exhortations, addressed to those engaged in theological training. I challenged the idea that [mere theological study ](https://rekindle.co.za/content/some-dangers-of-theological-study/ "Dangers of Theological Study")is adequate to prepare Christians for leadership and ministry. Unwittingly, and sometimes deliberately, theological institutes present biblical doctrine as truth to be stored in our heads rather than God’s truth for reshaping our hearts.

Of course, on occasion one might hear, as Michael Horton reminds us: doctrine is for discipleship. And reflecting on my own time at theological college, I believed that; only, it was to disciple others rather than myself. If our desire is to lead others, then we cannot divorce study—least of all theological study—from personal character formation.

In my [introductory post](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2022-02-02-character-of-a-theologian "Pursue Character") for this series I quoted Helmut Thielicke: "It is a commonplace we hear, and countless times have ourselves expressed, that theology has to do with life." Similarly, the necessity of humility and related danger of pride for theological students is "commonplace." But what does a humble pursuit of theology look like? At a more basic level, what is humility?

Since the relationship between pride and knowledge is well established (1 Corinthians 8:1), it is crucial that those attaining theological knowledge carefully consider the matter of pride, and make humility their ambition instead of theological acumen. For, at the risk of being repetitious, any proper theological training must at its core prioritise character over content. Fundamental to that character is humility. So what is it?

\[HEADER\]

Perhaps we should start answering the question by considering what humility is not—since most theologians love an apophatic definition.

For starters, it isn’t self-aware. In other words, someone who embodies humility won’t go through the day remarking—even if only to themselves—how humble they are. As C. S. Lewis’ Screwtape writes, "All virtues are less formidable to us once the man is aware that he has them, but this is specially true of humility. Catch him at the moment when he is really poor in spirit and smuggle into his mind the gratifying reflection, 'By Jove! I'm being humble,' and almost immediately pride—pride at his own humility—will appear." So, humility isn’t self-congratulatory. In fact, those who are genuinely humble will be taken aback when someone points it out to them.

Secondly, humility is not self-effacing or constantly deferring. Humble people won’t spend all their time trying to convince you they have nothing to boast about. This kind of constant deferral is ironically self-centred, a backhanded way of impressing others with your so-called humility. So while theology is about much more than what we know (content), humility doesn’t preclude dialogue—even debate. Humility doesn’t mean never wading into technical conversations, rather it informs why we want to and how we go about them. Studying theology entails a kind of knowledge. Never bringing that learning out to be tested and sharpened in theological discussions can therefore be disingenuous, the design not so much of humility as it is of desiring to appear so.

So humility doesn’t seek to draw attention to itself, whether this is through proud self-awareness or attention seeking deference. What is it, then?

RELYING ON YOUR COMMUNITY

Though there are many places to turn in defining humility—I’ve already quoted C. S. Lewis; there’s also the character of Jesus—I haven’t come across many better definitions than this one in [_Charitable Writing_](https://africa.thegospelcoalition.org/reviews/charitable-writing-is-about-character-not-style/ "TGCA Review: Charitable Writing")_, _by Gibson and Beitler III. They write, "Humility is the virtue that allows us to see not only our finitude and fallenness but also the goods of our communities. It allows us to recognise that we don’t have all the answers. It helps us to see the enormous contributions of others. For the humble person, dependence on others is not an embarrassment but a potential source of mutual benefit. Humility, in short, makes us teachable."

According to Gibson and Beitler III, humility is a virtue demonstrated relationally. It is interpersonal or communal. I highlight this because there is a real temptation for the theological student—and perhaps even more so for the theologian—to blaze a trail, alone. Of course, you won’t get through theological college without studying the set and seminal works. But you could reach the end without recognising the “goods” of your community, eschewing "dependance on others." This would not only be tragic but also a telling mark of pride. The humble theologian [locates herself within community](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2021-12-02-trinity "God's Threeness and Human Community"), learning from and leaning on others.

This goes hand in hand with being teachable, as we face "our finitude and fallenness." Importantly, here we mustn’t forget that theological study is incomplete if it remains conceptual—Thielicke’s theological "commodities," which we store in our heads. The Christian theologian is someone who fundamentally believes, or truly knows, that she doesn’t have all the answers; that he isn’t God’s priceless gift to the church or academy—that was Jesus. Being teachable isn’t about citing more sources in your theological writing. It’s a virtue, part of Christian character. Humility is seen in the readiness to listen to others, never forgetting that our hope for Christian theology is not ultimately greater learning but greater love. Such love is impossible when we proudly believe that others have nothing to teach us.

Pride has no place among God’s people, the community created and sustained by God’s gracious attention towards us. Too often the task of higher theological enquiry is carried out away from that community. This makes it easy to forget that, as Thielicke writes, "The truth of theology is concerned with the very love of God, with his coming down, his search, his care for souls." Indeed, it is Christ’s "coming down" that helps us recognise the sheer folly of the proudly independent theologian.

As Augustine says, in his _Confessions_, “He brings down reliance on themselves, makes them weak as they look directly at the divine weakness, wearing the same 'leather skin' we do. They collapse helpless into the weak arms where power now surges to lift them on high."
