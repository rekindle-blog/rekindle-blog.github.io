Recently I wrote **an article** calling on Christians to invest their attention more carefully. Beyond simply budgeting a finite resource, I argued that “how we invest our attention pays dividends in our own personal formation. In other words, “what we give our attention to has a direct impact on who we become.” But this isn’t limited to what we put before our eyes. It extends to our habits, requiring us to discern not only **the quality \[porn\]** of what we give our attention to as well as **the quantity \[line\]** of attention we’re willing to spend thoughtlessly.

Perhaps I can illustrate this, by developing an analogy I’ve used before: the similarities between our attention (or time) and money. It’s no coincidence that we refer to spending both, as well as wasting or investing them. Yet few of us give away money as freely as we do our attention and time. Most of us are greedy with our money and reckless with our attention. Now, you could claim: that only proves that money is a far more valuable resource. And you might be right. But I’m inclined to argue that it simply reveals our gross undervaluation of attention. We steward our money carefully, probably because we all want to have more of it. But we barely reflect on our **media habits** and how they might be shaping us.

In Hebrews 2:1 the author writes, “We must pay much closer attention.” He continues in Hebrews 2:2-3, urging Christians to pay more careful attention to Christ and our salvation. Reflecting on this verse, I wondered what else God exhorts us to give our attention to. A simple word search brought up a few results, which I will conclude this post with. But my search also yielded a host of things that God exhorts us to vigilantly guard against. Below I have selected three.

**\[1\] Virtue Signalling**

Firstly, in Matthew 6 Jesus says: “Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them.” At the risk of lifting this imperative from its historical context and landing it straight into the 21st century, Jesus is saying this: Don’t virtue signal. Stop grandstanding on social media. Don’t do stuff so that other people will notice you. Quit saying things—perhaps particularly on social media—so that people will think more highly of you. Don’t adopt positions and advertise them because they will earn you relational credit.

Now, there are innumerable New Testament passages exhorting Christians to love selflessly, sacrificially prioritise others, and learn genuine empathy. On one level, the basic Christian ethic is painfully straightforward: love both God and neighbour. The problem is this: we love ourselves. In fact, we love ourselves so much that we shamelessly leverage obedience to the simple Christian ethic in a way that promotes ourselves. Guard against virtue signalling. “Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them.”

**\[2\] Consumerism**

Secondly, speaking of God’s judgment Jesus warns: “Watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly like a trap” (Luke 21:34). The “cares of this life” are related to the “riches and pleasures of life” (Luke 8:14). In keeping with the rest of the New Testament, this is a warning against materialistic living, **consumerism** \[iPhone\]. The irony is that we all believe that more money to spend on more possessions will lead to significance and security. But Jesus teaches the very opposite, cautioning us against stuff, against the cares, riches, and pleasures of life.

Living when we do, this is probably one of the most countercultural things Jesus preached. But we know better than Jesus. For we would all prefer the weight of wealth than the faith born from having less. We incapacitate ourselves with cares, pursuing possessions and pleasures. Unsurprisingly, when we get them we only want more and remain unsatisfied. So our lives are marked by chasing things rather than God; consumerism sets us on a course away from Christ. That’s why Jesus’ warning is so stark, framed by the context of divine judgment. “Watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with \[the\] cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly like a trap.”

**\[3\] Grow bitter and resentful**

Finally, Paul warns both of his understudies against paying undue attention to “myths and endless genealogies” (1 Timothy 1:4; Titus 1:14). Only I don’t think this is a caution against reading J. R. R. Tolkien or Old Testament narratives. Within the **larger context of the pastoral epistles**, Paul is warning Christians against being drawn to controversy and dispute (1 Timothy 6:3-5; 2 Timothy 2:23-24). That makes it a timely and unsettling word, for we love a scandal.

Returning to the point that has pervaded this post, Paul is warning Christians about the stories we consume. I recently **argued this at length**, exploring the popularity of _The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill._ What is it that drives our insatiable appetite for investigative journalism and _exposes_, ministry failure and church scandal? I do believe that one of the driving factors is sharing in God’s heart, which longs for justice. But I worry that another factor is our masked delight in seeing others fail. Interestingly, the human fixation on controversy is not new. However, our access to a near infinite amount of content means Paul’s caution deserves sounding. Watch out that you don’t subsist on a diet of controversy.

## What Should We Invest Our Attention In?

So there you have it, three things that God exhorts us to be on guard against: virtue signalling, consumerism, and fixating on scandal. But what should we give our attention to? Very briefly, picking just three examples from the New Testament, God exhorts us to pay careful attention to **our salvation** (Hebrews 2:1-4), **corporate worship** (1 Timothy 4:13), and **Scripture** (2 Peter 1:19). Perhaps then we might turn our virtue signalling into meaningful justice; our consumerism into a desire for God; and our delight in controversy into constructive conversations.
