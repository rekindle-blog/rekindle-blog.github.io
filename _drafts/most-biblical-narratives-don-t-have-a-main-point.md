Ifemelu is sitting in a salon, having extensions braided into her hair when another customer notices that Ifemelu is reading. The other salon customer innocently asks her: what’s the book about? Annoyed—mostly for other reasons—the question rankles Ifemelu. She thinks, “Why did people ask ‘What is it about?’ as if a novel had to be about only one thing.” This brief scene is from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s _Americanah_. It’s a work well worth reading and reflection, but in this post I want to focus on Ifemelu’s ire towards the question: what’s the story about? Because I’m convinced that most novels aren’t explicitly “about only one thing.” This is also true of most biblical narratives.

Now, I’ve read _Dig Deeper_, did a ministry apprenticeship, sat through my fair share of preaching workshops, and even did three years of homiletics as well as biblical studies at Bible college. And I’ve reached the conclusion that the protagonist from _Americanah_, Ifemelu, speaks more sense concerning biblical narratives than most of my training ever managed. For stories, novels, and narratives rarely have a main point. The insistence that they do is usually a sign that someone has read more books about literary criticism than actual literature.

Consider the greatest story every written, Tolkien’s _Lord of the Rings_. What’s it about: our innate longing for **rest**, the pursuit of power, **friendship**, the existence of goodness and truth, or **the human condition**? Well, it’s about all of these. In fact, in his essay _Time and Tide_, C. S. Lewis called _Lord of the Rings_ a literary “master key,” going on to say, “use it on what door you like.” While you might disagree with Lewis’ bombastic hyperbole and obvious affection for Tolkien’s work, he’s undoubtedly more correct than the person who tries to tell you that _Lord of the Rings_ is about one thing—it isn’t. It doesn’t have a main point. Nor does any worthwhile novel.

No one puts down Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s _Brothers Karamazov_ and says: “of course, if God doesn’t exist then everything is permitted,” as if that’s all there is to it. I mean, it’s over 1000 pages long, penned by one of the greatest novelists who ever lived. What is **_Fight Club_** about? Or **_Watership Down_**? Does William Golding’s **_Lord of the Flies_** have a main point? What about **_Gilead_** or **_Home_**? I imagine those authors—at least those who’re still alive—would be uncomfortable with the question Ifemelu was asked in _Americanah:_ “What is it about?” For the answer is almost certainly: many things. Not every novel is a “master key.” Yet even the most ham-fisted airport literature offers some variety and nuance, rather than a main point. This is because novels and stories aren’t academic articles.

If you’re still reading I can only assume you agree with my thesis: great stories don’t have main points. This isn’t how they work—at least, it isn’t how those worth reading work. But then why do we treat biblical narratives differently? Why will grown men attending preaching seminars argue over the main point of a narrative from Judges, as if we were considering an episode of _Paw Patrol_?

Firstly, as Robert Alter **notes** in _The_ _Art of Biblical Narrative_ that by overemphasising the seriousness of the biblical text we’ve overlooked the sheer enjoyment of the stories therein. Alter continues, “the paradoxical truth of the matter may well be that by learning to enjoy the biblical stories more fully as stories, we shall also come to see more clearly what they mean to tell us.” This is a profoundly important observation. By crossing all our exegetical Ts and dotting every syntactical Is we easily lose the wood for the trees, dissecting stories as if they were arguments or Pauline epistles. But they aren’t. They’re stories. Stories rarely, if ever, have main points.

Secondly, anticipating the accusation of postmodern polyvalence, I’m not suggesting that stories can mean whatever we want them to. There are such things as authorial intent or purpose, structure, and the rest. I recently watched Pixar’s _Luca_ with my son, which is a delightful coming of age story, focused on an intimate friendship between two young boys. Unsurprisingly, claims could be heard that this was actually a romance, with undertones of homoerotic love and desire. That’s a poor ‘reading’ and obvious appropriating of _Luca._ There are meanings, themes, and ideas that we can rule out in our interpretation of stories. Yet affirming this doesn’t force us into insisting on a single, main point.

Robert Alter is again helpful here. While he is hesitant to enshrine a fixed, absolute meaning for any story, he nevertheless rejects the agnostic or postmodern approach to stories. We needn’t choose between modernity’s denuded interpretation of stories and postmodernity’s diorama of meanings. Well-told stories are nuanced—sometimes deliberately elusive. On top of that, the subjective as well as contextually located reader is bound up in the process of interpretation. In my opinion, extracting a main point with unwavering insistence is a poor reading of most narratives. Because stories don’t have main points.

### Sermons Can Have Main Points, but Stories Don't

Let me conclude by laying some of your concerns to rest. As Stibbs writes in his outstanding work on preaching, _Expounding God’s Word: “_Instead of using…the Bible as a peg on which to hang a string of ideas collected from elsewhere, the chosen text itself is allowed to provide the ideas.” Amen. This is as true for narratives as it is for epistles. However, we mustn’t paint ourselves into the corner of a main idea or point, especially when it comes to stories.

Sermons can have main points. Only we mustn’t be so wedded to the idea that ‘the main point of the text is the main point of the sermon’ that we retrofit our main point onto biblical narratives. So Stibbs writes, “The intending preacher must develop his expository treatment of the text in relation to a single dominant theme, and in its presentation must concentrate on the realisation of a corresponding practical aim in his instruction and exhortation.” With Stibbs I’d sooner concede that most stories have a “dominant theme.” God inspired narratives, many of them. These exist to (2 Tim 3). But to do that they don’t need a main point. I can’t find that step in rightly dividing the word of God in the pastoral epistles.
