At the 2016 Golden Globe Awards, Jim Carrey [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9J8GaeDqVc "YouTube: Golden Globe Awards 2016") the award for Best Motion Picture in the Musical or Comedy category. Before he came on stage the voice over introduced him: “From the upcoming film, _True Crimes_, please welcome two time Golden Globe winner, Jim Carrey.” His subsequent riffing off of that introduction wasn’t merely another indication of his comedic genius, but an insightful and almost [existential](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2020-07-03-nietzsche "Existentialism and Entertainment") reflection on our pursuits and purpose.

## Transcript

Thank you. I am “two time Golden Globe winner, Jim Carrey.” You know when I go to sleep at night. I’m not just a guy going to sleep. I’m “two time Golden Globe winner, Jim Carrey,” going to get some well needed shut eye.

And when I dream. I don’t just dream any old dream. No sir. I dream about being three time Golden Globe winning actor, Jim Carrey. Because then I would be enough. It would finally be true. And I could stop this, this terrible search. For what I know ultimately will not fulfil me.

But these are important, these awards. I don’t want you to think that just because if you blew up our solar system alone you wouldn’t be able to find us or any of human history with the naked eye. But from our perspective. This is huge.

## Conclusion

Personally, I’ve made a significant contribution to the amount of views this video has on YouTube. Admittedly, I’m a huge fan of Carrey’s over-the-top on-screen antics. However, it’s his maturation as a deep thinker and critic of celebrity culture that has impressed me in recent years.

It would be easy to weaponise some of Carrey’s speech to highlight the absurdity of our obsession with Hollywood. For example, Will Smith hitting Chris Rock at the Oscars has fuelled more heated conversations and social media ‘activism’—read: virtue signalling—than the war in Ukraine. “But these are important, these awards,” as Carrey wryly puts it. Only that’s not why I’ve produced a transcript of Jim Carrey’s short speech.

No. I’m far more interested in his sardonic and unsettling reference to receiving a third Golden Globe—or that elusive Oscar. “Then I would be enough. It would finally be true. And I could stop this, this terrible search. For what I know ultimately will not fulfil me.” Perhaps we laugh with the celebrities in the crowd, because we know Carrey’s words are true, terribly so.

What will truly satisfy you, at the level of your soul? Will you really be fulfilled when you reach your ambitions or receive that promotion? Then will you be enough? Content?
