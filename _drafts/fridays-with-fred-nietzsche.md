As I write this post it is two weeks since the murder of George Floyd. But it is very possible that you are reading it months, even years, after that event. Presently, around the world, and particularly in England and America, statues of many who were previously deemed heroes have instantaneously become villains—symbols of historical oppression and systemic racism. Of course, the unfortunate long term ailment of myopia is blindness. The the thunderous upheaval that ensued Floyd’s death drowned out every other voice from history. For example, the fact that Winston Churchill held off Hitler, so that America could wake up, was ignored amid invocations against him. Churchill wasn’t woke. He was a racist. But how should we think about actions in the past? How should we evaluate the morality of our forebears? In his _Aphorisms on Love and Hate_, Friedrich Nietzsche offers three interesting, not to mention contentious, suggestions.

## 1. "Judge Not, That You Be Not Judged"

Firstly, with a heavy hand of irony, Nietzsche quotes Jesus, “Judge not.” He continues, “When we consider earlier periods, we must be careful not to fall into unjust abuse. The injustice of slavery, the cruelty in subjugating persons and peoples, cannot be measured by out standards. For the standard for justice was not so widely developed then…it is just that the views dominant then were wrong and resulted in a consistency that we find harsh, because we now find those views so alien.” This quote can almost stand unadorned, without further comment. To put it simply, Nietzsche is warning against the age old temptation to use either our own personal standards or culture - or both - as the yardstick for morality throughout history.

Nietzsche goes on to suggest two problems with such an overinflated view of ourselves and the present: we are inconsistent and our forebears were ignorant. On our ignorant predecessors, Nietzsche writes, "Cruelty to animals, by children and Italians, stems from ignorance." Putting his intolerance of Italians aside, the point stands. Children are always growing and learning. We might say that so too is humanity. The application of this warning is that it is incredibly hard for us to be anything other than a creature of our culture and time. This is the reason precious few individuals stand out in history. Perhaps we should be slower to envision histories when we would have been the heroes and liberators. After all, it’s highly probable you wouldn’t have even murmured dissent, let alone raised your hand.

Nietzsche’s other warning against making our cultural moment the yardstick of morality is that it reveals our inconsistent double-standards at present—funnily enough, this was Jesus’ point in Matthew 7:7. As Nietzsche notes, "In our own time, we treat political heretics harshly and cruelly, but because we have learned to believe in the necessity of the state we are not as sensitive to this cruelty as we are to that cruelty whose justifications we reject." Let me paraphrase. We are not as sensitive to our own cruelty when we feel it is justified, as some kind of self-righteous rage and virtuous indignation. But these feelings, however strong and valid, do not excuse violence and hatred—as if bearing the names of past victims mitigates present wrongs.

## 2. People Follow Orders Given By Others

Nietzsche’s second point to help us think about morality and the past is just as discomfiting as the first. He writes, "In history much that is frightful and inhuman, which one would almost not like to believe, is mitigated by the observation that the commander and the executor are different people: the former does not witness his cruelty and therefore has not strong impression of it in his imagination; the latter is obeying a superior and feels no responsibility. Because of a lack of imagination, most princes and military leaders can easily appear to be harsh and cruel, without being so." While I am not an advocate for situational ethics, Nietzsche’s point is worth consideration.

As he notes, in much that is "frightful and inhuman…the commander and the executor are different people." This point could be simply refuted: both should have known better. But we must not forget that perpetrators of historical injustices were - as we saw above - ignorant. That observation compounds this one. Of course, neither of these facts are ultimately mitigating. They do not excuse evil. The "executor" should feel the weight of responsibility, owing to their agency. And despite their distance from the actual events, the "commander" is never absolutely unaware of what is being carried out.

Yet in each case there is room for a slightly more generous assessment than what is typical today. Do you really think that given power over others, the ability to order actions without seeing the consequences, you would have moderated their execution? Alternatively, under the frightful power of some prince or military leader, can you honestly say you would have been a conscientious objector? History presents us with very few cases of either. Perhaps the soldier silenced his troubled conscience by repeatedly telling himself he bore no responsibility. Likewise, from afar the commander looked to his unsullied hands. In both cases, we might also have persuaded ourselves we’re not responsible agents. We would be wrong. But let’s be more honest with ourselves—and generous to those who went before us.

3\. 

This third point does not follow those given above, and comes elsewhere in _Aphorisms on Love and Hate._ But it fits well. Nietzsche writes, "Good nature, friendliness, and courtesy of the heart are ever-flowing tributaries of the selfless drive and have made much greater contributions to culture than those much more famous expressions of this drive, called pity, charity." Nietzsche fits this broadly under the heading, "goodwill," which he describes as, "the continual manifestation of our humanity, its rays of light, so to speak, in which everything grows." Goodwill. Courtesy. Friendliness. In light of Nietzsche’s overall mood and predictable meanness, this exhortation is somewhat strange—if not a little hollow. But this only makes it more pointed in our own application.

 self-righteous indignation or virtuous, hate-filled rage. Therefore while Cain is judged, Yahweh will not tolerate revenge, however self-assured and supposedly . I think this narrative fits well my third point from Nietzsche.

Human history is dark. And we don’t even know the half of it. It contains innumerable injustices and terrible evils. As we seek to address these in the present and aim to undo the grave harms many people have inherited because of them, we should—we must—avoid becoming embroiled in our own bitterness and hate. Self-righteous indignation and virtuous rage cannot rewrite human history. Nor will it create a future without those things. The pendulum will simply swing. Instead, as Nietzsche suggests, goodwill, friendliness, love and generosity can make a significant contribution to culture and our communities, not to mention the future.
