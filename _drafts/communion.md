Last year I wrote a couple of articles on communion. The [first article ](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2021-11-16-communion "The Case for Weekly Communion")argued for the weekly celebration of communion. I made my case theologically, rooting my position in the Reformation, over against Evangelicalism’s overemphases on preaching, pragmatism, and individualistic worship. In the [second article](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2021-12-15-communion-spectacle "Is Weekly Communion too Boring?") I suggested that the reason so few churches who identify as Reformed don’t celebrate communion every Sunday is that it’s boring in comparison to the contemporary obsession with exciting, spectacular, and vibrant worship.

In this third post I want to address a common but unconvincing case against offering the sacrament every time the church gathers for Sunday worship. We might summarise it like so: repetition makes routine, and routine eventually empties something of its significance, meaning participants are left going through the motions. In other words, weekly communion becomes perfunctory.

Unfortunately, Gerald Bray seems to give voice to this concern as a possible argument against celebrating communion Sunday by Sunday. In his outstanding work, _God Is Love_, he writes: “Contrary to the intentions of the liturgical reformers, the sacrament has been trivialised and devalued by overuse, and so its significance in the life of the believer and the congregation has been observed."

The first and rather simple point against the supposed danger of weekly communion making the sacrament dryly routine, reducing it to going through the motions is that we don’t apply this logic to other aspects of corporate worship—especially not singing. You don’t ever hear: ‘We’ve taken singing out of the liturgy this week because we’re worried that it’s becoming a little mechanical and insincere. Then we go on to sing, “you’re a good, good Father,” 22 times in a single standing.

I mean, should we be worried about devotional Bible reading or daily prayer becoming a formality. Is this also an argument against spiritual disciplines, or the means of grace? Should we leave out the Bible reading and sermon this coming Sunday, because we did it last week? I trust your answer to those questions was ‘no.’ Thus overuse leading to hollow formality is not an argument against weekly communion, unless you’re ready to apply to a whole host of other practises.

Secondly, repetition that creates familiarity is only perceived negatively because we’ve believed the gospel of Apple: innovate, think differently. This is not how Christians have viewed liturgy throughout the ages. Even the Reformers who stripped the altars and railed against the pomp of Roman Catholic worship crafted their own liturgies, collects, and structured services. Indeed, they saw repetition as a means of formation, habit as a way to train our hearts. Many of us believe the opposite today. We think that innovation and spectacle-making is what will persuade and transform the next generations.

C. S. Lewis addresses this way of thinking in his _Letters to Malcom_, writing: "It looks as if they believed people can be lured to go to church by incessant brightening, lightenings, lengthenings, abridgements, simplifications, and complications of the service…Novelty, simply as such, can have only an entertainment value. And \[people\] don’t go to church to be entertained. They go to _use_ the service, or, if you prefer, to _enact_ it. Every service is a structure of acts and words through which we receive a sacrament, or repent, or supplicate, or adore. And it enables us to do these things best—if you like, it 'works' best—when, through long familiarity, we don’t have to think about it…The perfect church service would be once we were almost unaware of; our attention would have been on God."

Let me conclude by adapting [a point](https://rekindle.co.za/content/john-owen-and-asceticism/ "John Owen on Asceticism and Habit") I made years ago, with the help of John Owen. Paul writes: "I discipline my body and keep it under control" (1 Corinthians 9:27). Elsewhere he employs a similar image: "Train yourself for godliness" (1 Timothy 4:7). Picking up on this language, John Owen insisted that in order to effectively mature as believers we must get beyond the standard, contemporary tools: devotions, accountability, and sermons—as valuable as these are. Owen, along with many others before and after him, insists that we must incorporate our bodies and habits into formation. As the old saying goes, 'practice makes perfect.'

Few writers have done more for my own thinking around the value of repetition for embodied beings, such as ourselves, than James Smith. Listen to a few lines from _You Are What You Love:_ "The Lord’s Supper isn’t just a way to remember something that was accomplished in the past; it is a feast that nourishes our hearts. Here is an existential meal that retrains our deepest, most human hungers."

If you miss a meal during the day, you feel it in your body. You suffer pangs, as your body demands sustenance. The reason we’re so indifferent to whether our churches practice communion every week or not is the result of years of spiritual intermittent fasting. By this I mean we don’t long for communion—what Calvin calls "a spiritual banquet, wherein Christ attests himself to be the life-giving bread, upon which our souls feed unto true and blessed immortality"—because we’ve abandoned its regular practice. So many of us have starving souls and full minds.
