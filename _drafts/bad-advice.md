About a month back I posted a [miscellany](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2022-06-23-bad-advice "Bad Christian Advice") of bad Christian advice. In response to some of the criticisms I received regarding that post, let me say two things. Firstly, I’m sure most advice is given with the best intentions. No one goes out of their way to offer bad advice. Well, at least I hope no one does that. Only, and secondly, this doesn’t change the fact that the advice I collected was bad. And by “bad” I mean misleading, wrong, and unhelpful.

In a third post I plan to explore some of the reasons why bad advice seems to thrive almost as much as [gossip](https://africa.thegospelcoalition.org/article/gossip-a-sin-that-is-sadly-indigenous-to-the-church/ "Why Gossip is Indigenous to the Church") in the church. However, in this post I want to focus **on one thing…**

Before getting to **_my thing in this post_** that Christians end up offering bad advice, I should add that God affords tremendous value to counsel and community.

Picking just two examples from Proverbs, he says: “Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in the abundance of counsellors there is safety” (Proverbs 11:14); and “the way of the fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice” (Proverbs 12:15). Wisdom entails seeking out and inviting counsel, guidance, and advice.

The [wise person](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2021-06-29-james-3-jordan-peterson "Peterson on James 3") is "open to reason" (James 3:17). The purpose for my miscellany of bad advices was, therefore, not to discourage allowing others to speak into our lives. Nor did I want to create fear around the giving of advice. Christians should be those who regularly and readily ask for and offer sound advice.

### Advice in community, contextual and personal…

By listing select popular yet potentially harmful pieces of advice—given both to myself and others—I hoped to emphasise another aspect of wisdom. That it listens carefully and doesn’t rush to offer advice (James 1:19).

You see, my problem with so much conventional wisdom and Christian advice is that it is very often the opposite: half listening in order to thoughtlessly issue formulaic truisms—or platitudes. Almost none of the bad advice in my post was singular. They came in various forms from different people. Thus most Christians aren’t suffering for a dearth of advice. Rather, they’re struggling to sift the sheer amount of lazily rehashed advice.

Too much advice is pre-fabricated and impersonal. Too much advice speaks without listening. Too much advice is more suited to being made into a [motivational quote](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2021-08-11-costly-friendship "Should Friendship be Costly?") than meaningfully kneaded into a specific situation or context.

Owing to my line of work I’ve sat through many Christian conferences. I’ve read countless Christian books, articles, and blog posts. Sat under solid biblical preaching for decades. And as a result I’m never lacking for a great quote to share. I usually have more than one funny but ‘applicable’ anecdote on hand in response to a question. If you have a problem, I have a platitude.

I believe that much of the bad advice running rampant among Christians exists because it’s just easier to recycle what someone else said. If we’re honest, genuinely listening to someone’s questions or problems in order to provide contextual and careful advice is laborious. I’d much rather reach into my memory banks for something I heard once, which sort of fits with what you’re telling me.

We offer bad advice because all of us live in a merry-go-round of counsel tidbits and well-crafted quotes. Added to that our lives are usually too busy to invest the time required to properly listen and then provide thoughtful advice. If your advice sounds like a kind of greatest platitudes hits list, then it’s very likely unsuited to the person sitting in front of you—it’s also probably what I’d call bad advice.
