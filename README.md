[Rekindle](https://rekindle.co.za) strives to be a blog where Christian South Africans think in the open about culture, ethics, literature, Scripture and God in our context.

## About this repository

This is where we store all the good stuff.

 - Most of what you find here is going to be the data that fills the actual blog
 - It's just a github-pages site though
 - So really, you're finding a pretty neat jekyll theme here...
