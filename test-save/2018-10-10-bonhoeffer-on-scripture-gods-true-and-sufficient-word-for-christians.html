The first two articles looked at the writing of John Calvin: firstly <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/john-calvin-on-scripture-inventing-god/">challenging those who set their opinions about God above what he has revealed about himself</a>; and, secondly, correcting <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/john-calvin-on-scripture-the-letter-killeth/">the common error of separating the Spirit’s ministry from biblical truth</a>. In this post I am going to do little more than quote Dietrich Bonhoeffer at length and append a few comments. But if the name Bonhoeffer is unknown to you then I encourage you to put this article aside until you have read a little about <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/bonhoeffer-on-the-cost-of-discipleship/">his life and writing</a>. Below I have arranged four quotations from Bonhoeffer under three headings, two attributes of Scripture and our approach to it.</p>
<h3><b>The Bible is true</b></h3>
<p>Bonhoeffoer wrote, ”We have become accustomed to seeing religion as something that corresponds to a need of the human psyche, something that then satisfies this need. Something that is supposed to lead from the restlessness of our existence to calm, from the mad rush of our lives to tranquility. Something in which, quite removed from our jobs, professions and everyday lives, we can come to our true selves. Then we say religion is something beautiful, something valuable, something necessary for a good life. It is supposed to be the only thing that can make one truly happy in the depths of one's being. Meanwhile we tend to forget the one decisive question, whether religion is also something true, whether it is the truth. For it could be, of course, that while religion is a beautiful thing, it is not true, that it is all a nice, pious illusion—but still an allusion. And the most furious attacks on religion have been sparked by the fact that people in the church itself have often talked as though the question of truth were only  a secondary question. But whoever so speaks only sees religion from the perspective of human beings and their needs, not from that of God and his claims.”</p>
<h3><b>The Bible is sufficient</b></h3>
<p>"We want to keep this firmly in mind: the word of God, as found in the Bible and as it sounds forth to us in the proclamation of the gospel, needs no decoration. It is its own decoration, its own glory, its own beauty. This is certainly true. But as is especially true of human beauty, the word of God cannot withdraw itself from the decoration of those who love it. As is true of decorating that which is truly beautiful, the decoration of the word of God can only consist of making its own inner beauty shine forth all the more gloriously—nothing alien to it, nothing false, nothing artificial, no kitschy trinkets and no cosmetics, nothing that covers up its own beauty but only what reveals and brings it to light.” Throughout the ages churches have been tempted to update the gospel message (you can read what Paul says about that). Christians have also sought innovative methods to reach people. But I have to agree with Bonhoeffer: Bible teaching has and always will be God’s means of growing his church, numerically and spiritually. The word of God needs no decoration, just faithful proclamation and a commitment to and confidence in the truth.</p>
<h3><b>The Bible nourishes Christians</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/bonhoeffer-on-scripture-gods-true-and-sufficient-word-for-christians/people-book-girl-sitting-alone-reading-rock/" rel="attachment wp-att-2988"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2988" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/www.maxpixel.net-People-Book-Girl-Sitting-Alone-Reading-Rock-2604837-236x300.jpg" alt="Devotional" width="329" height="419" /></a>In an exposition on parts of Psalm 119, Bonhoeffer said, ”There is no standing still. Every gift, every increment of knowledge and insight I receive only drives me deeper into the word of God. For God's word I need time. To rightly understand the commands of God, I must often ponder their meaning for a long time. Nothing could be more wrong than the kind of intense activity or emotional high that denies the value of hard thinking and reflection. Such engagement with the Bible is also not just the business of those who are especially called to this vocation but the business of anyone who wants to walk in God's ways. Admittedly, it is often the case that God calls us to act quickly with no delay; but God also calls us to quietness and meditation. So I am often both permitted and required to halt for hours or days over one and the same word until I am enlightened with the right insight. No one is so advanced that he or she no longer needs to do this. No one may believe that he or she has been excused from this because of too many other active responsibilities. God's word claims my time. God himself has entered into time and now wills that I give him my time. To be Christian is not something that can be handled in a moment, but demands time. God has given us the Scripture, from which we are to discern God's will. The Scripture wants to be read and thought about, every day afresh.”</p>
<h3><b>Conclusion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></h3>
<p>The Bible is true and sufficient, able to make us wise for salvation and also shape us for service (<a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/four-god-given-uses-for-the-bible/">2 Timothy 3:15-17</a>). The Bible is God’s means for maturing believers, strengthening faith and correcting error. If we have understood this then it will show in our treatment of the Bible, for we will search and meditate on what God says. An unread Bible is not a sign of being too busy but a statement that hearing from God registers low, if at all, on your list of priorities. It is no wonder that our spiritual growth is stunted. The woman who refuses to refuel her car is not surprised when she has to stop on the side of the freeway. Listen to Bonhoeffer once more, “And those who love this word of God that has sounded forth for two thousand years have not let themselves be talked out of contributing the most beautiful thing they could make as its decoration. And their most beautiful work could be nothing else than something invisible, namely, an obedient heart, but from this obedient heart there springs forth the visible work, the audible song in praise of God and Jesus Christ.”</p>
