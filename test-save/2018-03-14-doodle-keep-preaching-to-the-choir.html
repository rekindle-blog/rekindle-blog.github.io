<p>“Now I know I’m preaching to the choir,” is something I have caught myself saying in the pulpit on numerous occasions, teaching on <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/can-i-be-a-christian-but-not-a-churchgoer/">the importance of belonging to a local church</a>. We say similar things when we discuss passages in small group that emphasise meeting together, encouraging other Christians and living in community. It is a cliché and therefore about as useful as it is original. When we meet together to hear God speak - as the Bible is read, taught, and applied - we may be the metaphorical choir but that does not make us any less in need of being convicted by the Spirit. Imagine a believer in the church who received the letter to the Hebrews shouting, after 10:25 was read, ‘Hey, we’re here; stop preaching to the choir.’ It’s ridiculous because God’s Word gathers us and addresses the gathered. Furthermore, you need only read Hebrews 10:24 to see that merely meeting together is inadequate, “Let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/doodle-keep-preaching-to-the-choir/church-choir-408412_640/" rel="attachment wp-att-2795"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2795" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/church-choir-408412_640-300x199.jpg" alt="Church" width="383" height="254" /></a>There is more to being a part of the church than meeting together. We must make no apology when emphasising the value as well as the purpose of meeting together, as if all of those who are gathered are committed to stirring one another up to love and good deeds. The gospel we preach does not simply say, ‘Come to church.’ That is the nominal poison believed and preached in many South African churches, especially among older generations. No, the gospel says that Christ has saved us for himself and <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/why-we-dont-serve-in-the-church/">to minister to his people</a>. We need to keep preaching to the choir because there are people regularly attending church who play <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/three-ways-to-encourage-prophecy-in-church-gatherings/">no active role in encouraging others</a>. If people are uncomfortable with the demands of Jesus then it may be because they do not know or love him. Certainly, one of the ways we show our love for Christ is by being concerned for the interests of his people (Philippians 2:19-30). Keep preaching to the choir.</p>
<p>Christ taught that <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/can-satan-grow-the-church/">the numerical size of local churches is a fraught statistic</a>, attendance can mean very little. Therefore, just as we do not apologise for preaching Christ and him crucified week after week, we should not baulk at challenging the gathered church about their personal investment in the local church. We preach the gospel Sunday by Sunday because it is a grave mistake to think the church visible is the church invisible. In a similar way, we keep seeking to convict Christians with regards to their love for God’s people, or lack thereof. Just as we keep preaching to spiritual corpses (Ephesians 2:1-3) we must keep preaching to the choir. We must regularly call for faith <i>and</i> repentance, not forgetting that all Christians still have much repenting to do. So keep preaching to the choir.</p>
<p>Since John Calvin kicked off this short series of posts thinking about <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/john-calvin-our-gifts-and-the-church/">our gifts and using them to serve the local church</a>, I will quote him as we finish. “And this is the place to upbraid those who, having nothing but the name and badge of Christ, yet wish to call themselves Christians…Either let them cease to boast of what they are not, in contempt of God; or let them show themselves disciples not unworthy of Christ their teacher” (3.6.4).</p>
