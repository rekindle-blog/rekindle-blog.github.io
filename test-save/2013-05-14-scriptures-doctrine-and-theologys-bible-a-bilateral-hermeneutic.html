<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/scriptures-doctrine-and-theologys-bible-a-bilateral-hermeneutic/ourobos/" rel="attachment wp-att-1158"><img class="alignright  wp-image-1158" alt="Circular hermeneutics" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ourobos-300x297.jpg" width="231" height="229" /></a>I recently wrote a post on what I labeled, <a title="Doodle: The Dangerous Evangelical Assumption" href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/doodle-the-dangerous-evangelical-assumption/">The Dangerous Evangelical Assumption</a>. In it I asked if we are in danger of limiting the work of the Holy Spirit to good exegesis. The comments made on the post helped me give some precision, which was originally lacking, and you can read the exchanges there. One comment raised the issue of the theological convictions with which we approach Scriptures. Scientific exegesis of a biblical text will not always bring us to the gospel of grace in Jesus Christ but instead gives us the author's intent or original meaning. Our understanding of Scripture means we interpret texts within their wider salvation context and therefore Christian exegesis asks how the author’s intent – attained through careful exegesis – fits within the message of Scripture as a whole, the gospel of our Lord. I want to repeat my response below with supplementation.</p>
<p>The Evangelical approach to Scripture is both presuppositional and a result of perspicuity. In other words, the Christian worldview presupposes that God is the single author behind Scripture, therefore Scripture is read with that view; and exegesis of Scripture has lead to the understanding that Scripture contains a single, unified and coherent message. Our doctrine of Scripture is founded on and flows from Scripture. How do these two characteristics of the Evangelical approach fit?</p>
<p>Firstly, Christians presuppose revelation is coherent because God is the author behind it. So, in our age of narratives, Scripture is viewed as a metanarrative scripted by God. During the Reformation, and in protestation to the Catholic claims of exclusive interpretive rights, the <i>analogia fidei </i>was introduced as a corollary to non-contingent divine revelation. We can only use the clearer parts of Scripture to interpret the murky bits because of this presupposition. Furthermore, if God is the cause of Scripture in its entirety we can ask the bigger question of authorial intent for the work as a whole.</p>
<p>Secondly, studied exegesis of Scripture has and does yield its perspicuous message: the gospel of grace. Though our interpretation of Scripture is based on a theological conviction, outlined above, that theological conviction is proven by exegesis. As we study Scripture we see that the parts contribute to and are enmeshed with the whole, the grand unifying theme of salvation in the gospel. I have already noted that our theology is a fruit of exegesis and I believe that careful exegesis of Scripture results in us being confronted with the summons to salvation, as well as proving the presupposition that God is the single author. Perspicuity is, as the Reformers emphasised, an objective attribute of Scripture.</p>

And we must hold that it is a dialogue and not a monologue. The latter would have us advance no further than Anselm’s <i>fides quarens intellectum</i> or Augustine's 'believing in order to understand'. There is no denying that we work from a presuppositional doctrine of Scripture yet, as John Webster reminds us, in his essay <i>On The Clarity Of Holy Scripture</i>, all dogmatic confessions are “wholly subordinate to the primary work of the church’s theology, which is exegesis.”</p>
<p>To close I will adapt something Karl Barth wrote in the introduction to the fourth edition of his commentary on Romans. We are never compelled to choose between strictly scientific exegesis and our doctrine of Scripture, for they enjoy an established and healthy bilateral relationship. And so, like Barth, we can expend all of our energy in endeavoring “to see through and beyond history into the spirit of the Bible, which is the Eternal Spirit. What was once of grave importance, is so still.”</p>
