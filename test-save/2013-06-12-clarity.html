<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-1240" alt="clarity" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/clarity.jpeg" width="240" height="170" />Graham has recently done <a title="Scripture’s Doctrine And Theology’s Bible: A Bilateral Hermeneutic" href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/scriptures-doctrine-and-theologys-bible-a-bilateral-hermeneutic/">some thinking</a> on clarity so I wanted to write to clarify my views, not so much for the reader but for my own sake. My major concern with popular articulations of clarity (or, if you prefer, perspicuity) is its limitation to the "gospel". That is, the definition that goes something like, "Clarity is that doctrine by which we mean the elements essential to salvation are clear in Scripture". The implication of this definition is that there are parts of Scripture that are unclear and this implication is leveraged as an explanation of why differing interpretations arise from a single passage.</p>
<p>Two important points the proponents of clarity make are (1) Scripture interprets Scripture (the unclear in light of the clear) and (2) clarity is not partial (that is, the "elements essential to salvation" are not only partially clear; they are fully clear). This is because the idea of clarity, if partial, is emptied of meaning: how is the interpreter to know which bit is unclear and which bit is clear? Following this, how is the interpreter to know which bits of Scripture to interpret in light of which others? Both of these points are important Scripture must guide our reading of Scripture and for clarity to mean clarity, it cannot be partial.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1241 alignleft" alt="focus" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/focus.jpeg" width="135" height="183" />My concern, however, is that by limiting clarity to "the elements essential to salvation" we are defining our clarity as partial. This leads, in my mind, to having to say that if we disagree about what is essential to salvation, either we must acknowledge that it is not essential (since it is not clear, and what is essential is clear), or we must conclude that our opponent is not a Christian since he cannot see what is clear. In our day and age we would probably opt for the former and the outcome would be a lowest common denominator kind of ecumenical Christianity but there are those who would err on the other side ending up with a "my way or the highway" type of Christianity. Let me, therefore, articulate the points I would want to make about clarity.</p>
<h2>What Clarity <em>Is</em></h2>
<p>First and foremost,<strong><em> clarity is the promise of God to communicate</em></strong>. Scripture, as the revelation of God, is His Word to us; we no longer have prophets but we do have the written Word, the communication of the incarnate Word. If Scripture is not clear, God fails at his attempt to communicate. Clarity flows from the character of God as light, communicating himself to us and penetrating our darkness.</p>
<p>Second, the promise of clarity is not to say that the truth is equally accessible and comprehensible to all though. Rather, <em><strong>clarity is the </strong><strong>promise that the truth is there and it can be searched out</strong></em>. Varying interpretations do not testify against clarity as though the commentators were wanderers in the dark. Nor does our clarity mean that each commentator is coming to his own truth as though the meaning is wrapped up in the subjectivity of each reader. Rather, varying interpretations testify to the fact that there is something to be gained by grappling with the text and more so in community with others who approach the same text illumined by the Spirit. Hermeneutics and exegesis are not aimless exercises where anything hit becomes a target; clarity teaches that truth is there to be sought.</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-1239" alt="information" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/information.jpeg" width="220" height="146" />Finally, <em><strong>the promise of clarity is unique to the reading of Scripture</strong></em>. This means that, where in any other field of reading and understanding, critical and creative thinking are at the top of Bloom's taxonomy, this is not the case when reading Scripture. The telos of the communication of God is not information but transformation. The scientific study that common grace affords the unbeliever does not, therefore, achieve the purpose of reading Scripture. The objective meaning of Scripture does not arrive at the recipient as a quiet guest but as one who would ransack the house of the sinful mind leaving everything on its head.</p>
