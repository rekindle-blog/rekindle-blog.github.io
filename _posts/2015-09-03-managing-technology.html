S. Lewis grumbled about how modern transport has annihilated space, “one of the most glorious gifts we have been given. It is a vile inflation which lowers the value of distance, so that a modern boy travels a hundred miles with less sense of liberation than his grandfather got from travelling ten.” The point of this series of blog posts has not been to denounce technology, pine after a bygone era, or deny the many benefits of the digital age. Rather I have hoped to convince readers that we are often blind to what technology takes from us. If you are like me, then Lewis’ reflection is striking, since you never considered how modern transport might deprive travellers the joy of a journey. It is a silly example, but it reiterates how we have been trained to receive new technology with open hands and tightly shut eyes. In this final post I want to suggest a few ways we might better manage technology.</p>
<p>I will start with a point made in <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/technology-saviour-or-servant/">an older post on technology</a>. Etymologically the word technology means ‘skill’ or ‘craft’, but – as I suggested in that post – humanity has a tendency to bow down to what it has made; “technology that was once held in our hands, now has many lying prostrate at its feet.” We cannot imagine life without our devices, we become despondent when we lose connectivity, and we check into on our digital worlds and profiles obsessively. So must ask to what extent we are in control? Does technology serve you, or is it slowly enslaving you? Let me state that technology is a wonderful gift, endowed by our Creator to further equip us for the task of subduing the created world. We should therefore receive technology gratefully and put it to work, assisting and serving us in most areas of life, but we must guard against being controlled by it. Each of us needs to carefully consider the status technology has earned in our own lives, for while its functions will vary, the human propensity to worship the created world rather than the Creator is always present.</p>
<p>I will now briefly comment on the remaining points raised in my posts, having dealt with freedom above:</p>
<p><strong>Attention</strong>: adapting something Donald Whitney wrote, I think that if we spent money as readily as we do our attention people would call us reckless. Surely there are times when uninterrupted focus is necessary. Multi-tasking – which Michael Horton says is often just a euphemism for distraction – is not always the most productive or beneficial use of our time. I know these suggestions are unthinkable, but you <em>can</em> turn your devices onto ‘do not disturb’ and block your internet connection in order to give undivided attention and time where it is required, be that people or tasks.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/managing-technology/cyberulyyahoo-it/" rel="attachment wp-att-2283"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2283" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3240991428_4691b3a4bc_o.jpg" alt="Technology" width="325" height="195" /></a>Thoughtfulness</strong> <strong>and introspection</strong>: please forgive my use of this abused, potentially misattributed, dictum from Socrates: <em>The unexamined life is not worth living</em>. Regardless of who said it, the sentiment is an urgently true one today. We need to move away from consuming information to contemplating knowledge. We need to recognise that the first hit on a Google search is not necessarily the most accurate or formative article on a subject. We need to put effort into reading and reflecting on – even studying – ideas and concepts. We could all use more quiet time and solitude, away from the invasive presence of our devices and demanding digital platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Memory</strong>: I have heard it said that our brains have many similarities to muscles; that is, when exercised they are healthy, but left unused they atrophy. The outsourcing of our memories and immediately accessible information means that while we have answers quickly we rarely have our own answers, nor do we see any need to furnish our minds. The result of this is weakening of our ability to retain information and ideas. I am not talking about what <em>Mega Memory</em> can offer you, as useful as being able to recall the order of two packs of playing cards might be, but rather a mind that is sharpened and in shape. The ways to achieve this are endless: learning a language; slowing down to consider a point in an article, book, or film; trying to remember a piece of information before Googling it; learning quotes and sayings off by heart; and so on.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/managing-technology/family_watching_television_1958/" rel="attachment wp-att-2284"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2284" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Family_watching_television_1958-300x279.jpg" alt="Technology" width="300" height="279" /></a>Values</strong>: this was the final point made in <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/more-ways-technology-takes/">More Ways Technology Takes</a> and, for lack of a better heading, I argued that today we are inundated with information and easy entertainment that warps our values and thrives off of undiscerning consumerism. This is well illustrated in an exchange between Hermoine Granger and Rita Skeeter, in <em>Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix</em>. Hermoine is entreating Rita to write the truth about Harry and the return of You-Know-Who, but Rita tells her that the <em>Daily Prophet </em>cannot run stories that will unsettle the comfortable wizarding world. Then Hermoine scathingly asks, “So the <em>Daily Prophet </em>exists to tell people what they want to hear, does it?” And Rita retorts, “The <em>Prophet</em> exists to sell itself, you silly girl.” We need to be deliberate about the data and dramas we greedily ingest. Work hard in discerning what you read and view, its purpose and bias. Remember that just because something is being broadcast or receiving masses of media attention that does not necessarily mean it is significant. Lastly, it is undeniable that we are subtly shaped, even if only slightly, by what we consume.</p>
<p>Let me leave you with three concluding points for reflection: firstly, technology is a wonderful tool, given by God, but let us be wary of the human inclination to worship the creation; secondly, though technology is almost always morally neutral, our use of it is often not; thirdly, managing our technology means more than benefiting from its many positives, we must be alert to its many drawbacks.</p>
