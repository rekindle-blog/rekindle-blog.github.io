excerpt: "Perhaps you've noticed that I have an interest in quality music that is
  quality in two ways; musically and lyrically.\r\nWell, I believe that Tim Challies
  has pointed me to just such an artist in Matthew Smith. These words were modified
  from a hymn written by William Cowper (a contemporary of John Newton who wrote \"Amazing
  Grace\", if you don't know who Cowper is, check out the biographies John Piper has
  done) but Smith has written new music for it and it sounds great. You can stream
  his whole album for free (14 tracks) here. By the way, don't only listen to this
  one - there are a few other really good tracks there; I really appreciated \"Goodnight\".\r\n"

<center><em>Watch The Rising Day</em><br />
~<br />
My former hopes are fled<br />
My terror now begins<br />
I feel, alas, that I am dead<br />
In trespasses and sins<br />
Ah, whither shall I fly?<br />
I hear the thunder roar<br />
The Law proclaims Destruction nigh,<br />
And Vengeance at the door<br />
Vengeance at the door, Vengeance at the door<br />
When I review my ways<br />
I dread impending doom<br />
But sure a friendly whisper says<br />
"Flee from the wrath to come."<br />
I see, or think I see, a glimmering from afar<br />
A beam of day that shines for me<br />
To save me from despair<br />
Save me from despair, save me from despair<br />
Forerunner of the sun<br />
It marks the pilgrim's way<br />
I'll gaze upon it while I run<br />
And watch the rising day<br />
Forerunner of the sun<br />
It marks the pilgrim's way<br />
I'll gaze upon it while I run, and watch the rising day<br />
Watch the rising day, watch the rising day</center></p>
