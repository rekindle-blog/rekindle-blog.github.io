excerpt: As evidenced by the fact that you are reading what I have written, I am part
  of the generation that blogs. Those who find themselves a part of this
  generation probably blog thanks to a slightly overinflated ego. One of the
  most common threads in these blogs is that of criticism because there's always
  someone who's doing or saying something stupid. They're all a bunch of
  hypocrites though...

Those who find themselves a part of this generation probably blog thanks to a slightly overinflated ego. One of the most common threads in these blogs is that of criticism because there's always someone who's doing or saying something stupid. They're all a bunch of hypocrites though...</p>
<p>In Luke 6:42 Jesus argues, "How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye." It is lamentable to me that I am associated with this generation of critics who do not take heed of Jesus' advice. They are so quick to point out specks in the eyes of others that they don't have time to pull the logs out of their own. "Bloggers" is the perfect term for these poor wretches: derived from "web" and "loggers" because they write on the web and they are the lumberjacks of the ocular world. I write this because, people of my generation, I am more than willing to help you remove those logs.</p>
<p>I find myself surrounded by hypocrites.<br />
'God, I thank you that I am not like other men'</p>
