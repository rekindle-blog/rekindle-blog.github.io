<p>Timothy Keller muses, in <em>Prayer</em>, “It is remarkable that in all of his writings Paul’s prayers for his friends contain no appeals for changes in their circumstances. It is certain that they lived in the midst of many dangers and hardships. They faced persecution, death from disease, oppression by powerful forces, and separation from loved ones. Their existence was far less secure than ours is today. Yet in these prayers you see not one petition for a better emperor, for protection from marauding armies, or even for bread for the next meal. Paul does not pray for the goods we usually would have near the top of our lists of requests.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/?attachment_id=2439" rel="attachment wp-att-2439"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2439" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/the-arrest-of-christ-kiss-of-judas.jpgBlog-300x294.jpg" alt="Giotto - Kiss of Judas" width="300" height="294" /></a>The point, as Keller goes on to develop, is not that we should never appeal to our heavenly Father for change or respite during hardship and suffering, but that we must take care that our prayers are neither limited to nor led by these requests. As Paul writes in a verse most readers will be familiar with, “In every situation, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, tell your requests to God” (Philippians 4:6). Paul then provides the antidote for anxiety, “The peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:7). Prayer is entrusting ourselves in faith to God, not necessarily receiving our petitions, but knowing his peace. But what does that have to do with Easter?</p>
<p>In Gethsemane, Jesus models prayer that is submissive to the Father’s will despite remaining unanswered. As Mark Jones puts it in <em>Knowing Christ</em>, “He knew <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/holy-week-what-lies-ahead/">his hour had come</a>; but this ‘hour’ would be his most difficult hour, and he would need strength from God to undergo the massive trial that was yet before him.” As I wrote in <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/lukes-innocent-jesus-a-point-from-repetition/">another post</a>, Jesus is neither valiant nor stoical as he prepares himself for the task at hand. He pleads with the Father. He begs, “Let this cup pass from me.” His soul was deeply pained (Mark 14:34) and he experienced agony as he prayed (Luke 22:44). The disciples had not seen their master looking more pitiable and pained. Jesus looks weak. However, his faith is strong as he prays, “Not what I will, but what you will.” Jesus’ faith is not challenged by unanswered prayer; it is evident through it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/?attachment_id=2438" rel="attachment wp-att-2438"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2438" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1117px-Giotto_Crucifixion.jpg" alt="Giotto - Crucifixion" width="304" height="279" /></a>In his short prayer, offered up three times, Jesus boldly entreats his Father yet is ultimately resigned to the Father’s will. And it is striking that as his enemies approach to arrest him, Jesus’ resignation turns to resolve, to fortified trust his God and Father. When the band of soldiers call for Jesus, he confidently answers, “I am he” (John 18:5). That shift takes place so quickly that we rarely appreciate what has happened. Prayer has emboldened Jesus’ faith despite being denied what he asked for. Prayer was Jesus’ means of entrusting himself to the Father’s will. Despite the <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/good-friday-the-cry-of-dereliction/">God forsakenness</a> that Jesus anticipates beyond his arrest and trial, having pleaded with the Father to take the cup from him, Jesus’ prayers ground his trust in the Father’s purposes.</p>
<p>Reflecting on Jesus’ prayers should cause us to reflect on and even change our own, both <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/prayer-resigned-and-stubborn/">how we pray</a> and what we pray for. The content of our prayers should not be entirely shaped by our circumstances. Our faithfulness in prayer should not depend on God answering us. As Jesus asked in Luke 18, “When the son of man comes, will he find faith on earth?” Many today would measure faith by the outcomes of prayer, when in Jesus’ life we see that faith is wholehearted trust in God despite its results.</p>
