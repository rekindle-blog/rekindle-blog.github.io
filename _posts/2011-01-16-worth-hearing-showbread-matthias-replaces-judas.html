  I was driving around town with a friend the other day when this song started
  playing. As soon as it came on he turned to me and told me to shut up. He then
  turned up the volume to the point where I felt droplets of blood trickling out
  of my ear. Since I had nothing else to do I figured I might as well give the
  song a listen. I wasn't disappointed. "

As soon as it came on he turned to me and told me to shut up. He then turned up the volume to the point where I felt droplets of blood trickling out of my ear. Since I had nothing else to do I figured I might as well give the song a listen. I wasn't disappointed.</p>
<p>And neither will you be. I say this because I feel it would be remarkably sinister for me to not share this song with you. In fact, I feel so strongly about this that I even endured the painfully slow speed of my ADSL connection to grab you both a youtube video and the lyrics. I have since found out that I do not have the necessary technical skills to get the youtube video to appear on this page. So instead I provide you with a link to the video (http://bit.ly/eo01qH) and the lyrics below. <em>[Ed: easily fixed by any fantastic webmaster]</em></p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>Lyrics:</strong></p>
<p><em>It is so that my transgressions have born a withered fruit,</em><br />
<em> The sun has scorched the rising plants, alas they have no root,</em><br />
<em> The bleached bones of animals bound by leather strips,</em><br />
<em> Dance through the air with laughter as I wield this wicked whip.</em></p>
<p><em>As you did warn me carpenter, this world has weakened my heart,</em><br />
<em> So easily I disparage, self-seeking the work of my art,</em><br />
<em> And there you have come to me, at the moment I bathe in my sorrow,</em><br />
<em> So in love with myself, sought after avoiding tomorrow,</em></p>
<p><em>Where do you find the love to offer he who betrays you?</em><br />
<em> And offer to wash my feet as I offer to disobey you,</em><br />
<em> Your beauty does bereave me, and how my words do fail,</em><br />
<em> So faithfully and dutifully I award you with betrayal.</em></p>
<p><em>The weak and the downtrodden fall on broken legs,</em><br />
<em> As I walk past a smile I cast, fervor in my stead,</em><br />
<em> But my bones like plastic, do buckle backward now,</em><br />
<em> I lay in this field by Judas, anticipate the plow.</em></p>
<p><em>I cannot be forgiven, my wages will be paid,</em><br />
<em> For those more lovely and admirable is least among the saved,</em><br />
<em> And where would I fit, Jesus? What place is left for me?</em><br />
<em> The price of atonement is more than I've found to offer up as my plea.</em></p>
<p><em>Jesus, my heart is all I have to give to you, so weak and so unworthy,</em><br />
<em> This simply will not do, no alabaster jar, no diamond in the rough,</em><br />
<em> For your body that was broken, how can this be enough?</em><br />
<em> By me you were abandoned, by me you were betrayed,</em><br />
<em> Yet in your arms and in your heart forever I have stayed.</em></p>
<p><em>Your glory illuminates my life, and no darkness will descend,</em><br />
<em> For you have lived forever and your love will never end.</em></p>
