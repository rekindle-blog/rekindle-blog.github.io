<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/?attachment_id=2215" rel="attachment wp-att-2215"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2215" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/woolworths2.jpg" alt="Woolworths Food" width="207" height="244" /></a>There are hundreds of thousands of Christian blogs out there, reflecting the wonderfully broad spectrum of our faith; you are reading one of those right now. With the advent of the digital age more Christians from across the globe are able to share the truth in love, engage in meaningful conversation, pursue theological enquiry to the praise of our God, and encourage one another to persevere – well, that is at least how Christian blogging could be done. But with the overwhelming number of options available where should we start, which blogs should you frequent (apart from Rekindle)?</p>
<p>Before answering that question I would like to speak about <em>Woolworths</em>, with the hope that its significance to our question above will become apparent. <em>Woolworths Food</em> has revolutionised the middle class South African’s kitchen, mostly in demanding more fridge/freezer storage and less counter space for preparation; “Eat in for under R150,” “Heat and eat in less than 20 minutes,” and “Organic” cry out from the aisles of our local Woolies, adulating their lord and ours: convenience. As you can tell, I have enjoyed my fare share of <em>Woolworths’</em> food and will unashamedly continue to do so. But it is undeniable that convenience has supplanted cooking, and by cooking I mean more than heating the oven to 180˚C while you defrost a readymade lasagne in the sink. Preparing meals from recipes and working with raw ingredients is a dying art in many homes, though my numerous attempts at <em>actually </em>cooking – with varied degrees of success – have nearly always resulted in something tastier than what I get out of a container. And though we hate to admit it, we know that culinary effort does not only produce better meals but much healthier dishes too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/?attachment_id=2214" rel="attachment wp-att-2214"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2214" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/StackOfBooks1-225x300.jpg" alt="Reading" width="225" height="300" /></a>But what does that have to do with blog posts, or theology for that matter? Am I going to answer the question from our first paragraph, listing recommended theological blogs? No. I want to make another point: blogs are indicative of our bondage to convenience and resistance to putting the time or energy into thinking about theology. What you can find on blogs, is not that dissimilar from the aisles of Woolworths: already packed and par-cooked thoughts; microwavable musings; and <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/a-doodle-on-tulip-was-calvin-a-calvinist/">Calvin’s entire theology in 5 simple points</a>. Do not mishear me. Please keep reading Christian blogs (especially Rekindle). But do not leave all of your engagement and interaction with deep, rich theology to someone else that will neatly pack it for you online, replete with eye-catching images. Do some hard work, delve into doctrinal ideas, tackle theological tomes, and invest intellectually in reaching your own conclusions. Sure, sometimes you will have to grab something off the shelf and gobble it down. But that cannot be your staple: it is unhealthy, lazy, and the opposite of thoughtful Christian discipline.</p>
