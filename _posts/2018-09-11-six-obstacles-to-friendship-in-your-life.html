<p>Friendship is a wonderful gift from God. Over the years I have gratefully enjoyed its fruits, though not without effort and commitment. On occasion I have been asked to teach on the topic, and I have tried to make that material available at Rekindle: <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/friendship/">defining friendship and its purposes</a> as well as appreciating it as an <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/reflection-heaven-and-friendship/">eternal gift</a>. Recently I was handed the privilege of preaching on the topic, so I took the chance to rework my material and supplement it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/six-obstacles-to-friendship-in-your-life/travel-holding-people-together-phone-wanderlust/" rel="attachment wp-att-2964"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2964" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/www.maxpixel.net-Travel-Holding-People-Together-Phone-Wanderlust-2237666-300x255.jpg" alt="Friends" width="338" height="287" /></a>Reflecting on the many obstacles to friendship I realised that friendships must survive in a hostile environment, fraught with threats and challenges. So here are some of the obstacles to friendship that I have experienced in my own life and culture. The list is far from comprehensive and you will very likely think of more, which I hope you will add in the comments. But my intention in listing them here is to make you aware of the obstacles to friendship and encourage you to strive harder for this glorious, satisfying and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> sanctifying </span>gift.</p>
<h3><b>Friendship is undervalued</b></h3>
<p>Like a sunroof or cupholders, we tend to think of friendship as a 'nice to have’. We do not consider it essential but an added extra. The result of this thinking is that we have a low estimation of friendship. If you believe something is not necessary you are unlikely to think it is important. But as I argued in a previous post defining friendship biblically, "Friendship involves complete vulnerability, the joining of two people’s souls in a wonderful love that reflects the nature of God.” This should not be undervalued but undertaken with concerted devotion.</p>
<h3><b>Marriage has supplanted friendship</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/six-obstacles-to-friendship-in-your-life/5968782974_6362cd5e26_m/" rel="attachment wp-att-2963"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2963" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/5968782974_6362cd5e26_m.jpg" alt="Wedding" width="218" height="329" /></a>While I affirm that marriage is also a tremendous gift from God I fear that an unhealthy emphasis on it means friendship is overshadowed, and friends are forgotten. We make the mistake of believing that one person (our spouse) will be able to meet all of our relational and emotional needs, as if one single relationship (marriage) removes the need for all others.</p>
<h3><b>Increased mobility</b></h3>
<p>We move around, relocate for work and chase our ambitions into new neighbourhoods and countries. This impermanence is relationally disorienting and probably one of the reasons marriages turn inward and become isolated. Anyone who has relocated will know that finding community and creating new friendships is challenging, and often ends in loneliness. As Rod Dreher writes in <em>The Benedict Option</em>, "If you are going to put down spiritual roots...you need to stay in one place long enough for them to go deep."</p>
<h3><b>Technology</b></h3>
<p>Following from the previous point, perpetually moving around we convince ourselves that we can remain ‘connected’. I will admit that I am indebted to platforms such as Skype and FaceTime but mediated communication (and friendship) falls short of the true glory of friendship. Despite all the benefits of these tools, which we ought to also praise God for, they are simply no substitute. 1000 friends on Facebook cannot stave my loneliness; nor can a video call provide the physical comfort and presence of a friend when it is desperately needed.</p>
<h3><b>We are suspicious of intimacy</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/six-obstacles-to-friendship-in-your-life/317px-bromances/" rel="attachment wp-att-2962"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2962" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/317px-Bromances-198x300.jpg" alt="Friendship" width="246" height="373" /></a>In his book titled <i>Spiritual Friendship</i>, Wesley Hill develops what he calls the “Freudian myth”, the idea that the terminus of intimacy between two people is always romantic or sexual. On once occasion, after speaking to teenagers about friendship some of the guys came up to me and said words like vulnerability, affection and intimacy cannot exist between guys for fear of being perceived as homosexuals. We might easily laugh that off, but most adults probably limit those adjectives to romantic relationships. But when we see two friends visibly loving delighting in each other we assume they desire something more than friendship.</p>
<h3><b>Unbiblical idea of masculinity</b></h3>
<p>Admittedly a generalisation and perhaps this is linked with the previous point, many men I know stick to the shallows in their friendships, revelling in the superficial and bonding over the inane. A lot of people have the strange notion that being a man means independence, strength, apathy and the complete childish avoidance of anything deemed effeminate. This has not resulted in generations of impressive men but boys with serious emotional and social limitations.</p>
<p>So there you have it, a far from comprehensive list of obstacles to friendship in our world today. Please interact with anything I have raised or add your own below. Returning to the first point, until we are convinced that God has given us friendship and imbued it with significant potential we will settle for cheap imitations and shadows.</p>
