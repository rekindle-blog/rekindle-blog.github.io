Earlier this year I had the opportunity to present a talk on Friedrich Nietzsche at [KRUX](https://www.krux.africa/), a Christian Study Centre out in Stellenbosch that "disciples young adults through theological education, mentoring, community, and a unique focus on the arts." Now anyone who frequents Rekindle—I love you, mom—wouldn’t deem it particularly noteworthy that I presented on Nietzsche, given that I’ve been engaging with him in writing since 2020. But during the Q&A that followed my talk, one of the attendees asked why I bother reading Nietzsche, given his sustained and infamous disdain for almost all things Christian. This is, I think, an important question worth considering.

In the talk itself I’d retold how I’d started reading the German philosopher and why I persevered with him. Being persuaded of both general revelation and common grace I knew that God has not left himself without a witness outside of the Bible (Romans 1__), nor has he withheld his goodness from the world he’s made. For this reason Herman Bavinck writes, "theology is not in need of a specific philosophy" *(Reformed Dogmatics* 1:609). He goes on to say that theology "is not per se hostile to any philosophical system and does not, *a priori* and without criticism give priority," to Plato or Aristotle or some other philosopher or system. Rather, "It brings along its own criteria, tests all philosophies by them, and takes over what it deems true and useful." In many ways, Nietzsche is an outstanding test case for my own theological convictions.

Proceeding from the above, I laid out a selection of Nietzsche’s strengths I’d observed in reading him. For starters, he was an incredibly astute psychologist, in the older sense of the word. That is, he was a student of human motives and behaviour, nature and desire. Secondly, he advocated for a *vita contemplativa*, a life of contemplation and thought. Thirdly, no one was safe from his searching criticisms. So, far from modern caricatures, he didn’t only lampoon Christianity but also Enlightenment thought, Darwinism, nationalism and the *zeitgeist.* Finally, Nietzsche was ultimately an existentialist, rather than a nihilist. In other words, he ardently desired that people flourish; his philosophy wasn’t abstract but aimed at human happiness. Taken together, there are great reasons for reading him.

But let me not assume you’re convinced. After all, the attendee who asked that question had heard all of the above—and more. Yet he still didn’t see the value of reading the self-appointed anti-Christ. Part of me wondered if his question arose from the suspicion Christians have towards philosophy in general. This suspicion is often seen in lazy handwaving, smugly dismissing these silly men and women who lock themselves away to think about nothing practically meaningful. But when it comes to Nietzsche, he was more than a philosopher; he was a prophet, announcing the demise of Christianity and advocating for us to remake the world without it. So I understand the question and its reticent backdrop. I mean, might not reading Nietzsche be bad for you? That’s another way to ask it.

On the night I had this question put to me I answered it like this, turning the question back on those asking whether we should study philosophy: should we only read books and listen to talks delivered by Christians and theologians? The way I see it, calling for a moratorium on reading Friedrich Nietzsche—and his ilk—creates a difficult way forward. Why shouldn’t we read him? If the answer is that he that he wasn’t a believer, that rules out the vast majority of written works through the ages and at present; if it’s that he was antagonist towards Christianity, so too are Plato and Aristotle’s philosophical systems, or Jordan Peterson’s popular thought. If you don’t think we should read Friedrich Nietzsche then you should also haul a lot of other books of your shelves—and scrub your YouTube while you’re at it.

In recent years I’ve steadily grown in my appreciation of Eugene Peterson. So it was serendipitous to learn that he was himself a student of the German philosopher. In fact, the title of his *Long Obedience in the Same Direction* plays on a passage from Nietzsche’s *Beyond Good and Evil* (§188). He could do this because he understood some of the theology I alluded to above, particularly common grace. As he puts it in *When Kingfishers Catch Fire*, "Even our so-called secular lives are permeated by grace." In fact, let me conclude with the section that precedes this line.

"I quit sorting books and magazines and journals into Christian and secular, with a preference for Christian. I read the secular, of course, but not with the same attention as the Christian. I had made a pretty sharp division between reading the Bible scholars and theologians and reading the newspaper, supplemented with detective novels and literary fiction. Eventually the division lines disappeared. It all took place in God’s world and kingdom. The Holy Spirit used anything and anyone. And if the Holy Spirit could do it, so could I."
