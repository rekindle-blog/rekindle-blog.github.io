<p>What a fantastic reminder; today, a couple thousand years ago a Galilean carpenter/teacher proved to be more than just a rabbi or even a prophet but the very Saviour of mankind.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of Jesus' identity, Melito of Sardus (a second century bishop) wrote this:<br />
<center><strong>Who is this Jesus?</strong><br />
And so he was lifted up upon a tree and an inscription was attached indicating who was being killed. Who was it? It is a grievous thing to tell, but a most fearful thing to refrain from telling. But listen, as you tremble before him on whose account the earth trembled!<br />
He who hung the earth in place is hanged.<br />
He who fixed the heavens in place is fixed in place.<br />
He who made all things fast is made fast on a tree.<br />
The Sovereign is insulted.<br />
God is murdered.<br />
The King of Israel is destroyed by an Israelite hand.<br />
This is the One who made the heavens and the earth,<br />
and formed mankind in the beginning,<br />
The One proclaimed by the Law and the Prophets,<br />
The One enfleshed in a virgin,<br />
The One hanged on a tree,<br />
The One buried in the earth,<br />
The One raised from the dead and who went up into the heights of heaven,<br />
The One sitting at the right hand of the Father,<br />
The One having all authority to judge and save,<br />
Through Whom the Father made the things which exist from the beginning of time.<br />
This One is "the Alpha and the Omega,"<br />
This One is "the beginning and the end"<br />
The beginning indescribable and the end incomprehensible.<br />
This One is the Christ.<br />
This One is the King.<br />
This One is Jesus.<br />
This One is the Leader.<br />
This One is the Lord.<br />
This One is the One who rose from the dead.<br />
This One is the One sitting on the right hand of the Father.<br />
He bears the Father and is borne by the Father.<br />
</center><br />

<p>Today I read part of Carson's book "Scandalous" on <a href="http://www.crossway.org/blog/2010/04/gods-punishment-borne-by-god/" rel="nofollow">Crossway's blog</a> and I thought that this pretty much sums it up:</p>
<p><i>Nothing is more central to the Bible than Jesus' death and resurrection. The entire Bible pivots on one weekend in Jerusalem about two thousand years ago. Attempts to make sense of the Bible that do not give prolonged thought to integrating the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus are doomed to failure, at best exercises in irrelevance. Jesus' own followers did not expect him to be crucified; they certainly did not expect him to rise again. Yet after these events their thinking and attitudes were so transformed that they could see the sheer inevitability that Jesus would die on a cross and leave an empty tomb behind, and absolutely everything in their lives was changed.</i></p>
<p>Indeed, it is the climax of all of history. In closing - because the other guys always say it better than I can - I am reminded of the words of Calvin. As you read, replace the word "gospel" with "message of the cross".<br />
<i>Without the gospel everything is useless and vain; without the gospel we are not Christians; without the gospel all riches is poverty, all wisdom folly before God; strength is weakness, and all the justice of man is under the condemnation of God. But by the knowledge of the gospel we are made children of God, brothers of Jesus Christ, fellow townsmen with the saints, citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven, heirs of God with Jesus Christ, by whom the poor are made rich, the weak strong, the fools wise, the sinner justified, the desolate comforted, the doubting sure, and slaves free. It is the power of God for the salvation of all those who believe.</i></p>
