Recently, however, I have noticed these techniques give way to the sure-fire connection that is made when the person upfront talks about <em>brokenness</em>. At a prayer meeting someone lamented,</p>
<blockquote><p>We are broken people<br />
Living in a broken world<br />
Breaking things</p></blockquote>
<p>And on reflection, I wouldn't argue with it.</p>
<p>I also didn't argue with it when it was said because we were talking about plenty of truly broken things in people's lives. Things over which they had no control and that introduced seemingly senseless pain. Brokenness is a word that captures this idea really well and yet, I remember a time when I would have said, “We are<em> fallen</em> people living in a <em>fallen</em> world.” So I've been wondering about the difference.</p>
<p>My church did a series on Joel - the minor prophet who spends three chapters finding synonyms for “swarm of locusts.” The locusts come as God's judgement on Israel. “Why are you telling me this?” you ask. Because somehow we did not talk about judgement in the series: week one: “the power of stories,” week two: “the possibility that pain is for our good,” week three: “the hope for restoration” (<em>my titles</em>). Each week the worship leader would welcome us and talk about how we probably all had rough weeks and that we come together as broken people to be refreshed by the Word and I was being my usual (non-critical) self thinking, “what happened to <em>sin</em>?”</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-2559 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/broken-jar-e1471210850276.jpg" alt="Broken Jar" width="180" height="182" />Then it dawned on me. <em>Brokenness is something that happens to us</em>. Jars get dropped, balls hit windows, iphones fall out of pockets - they all <em>get</em> broken and they are broken through no fault of their own. Broken things are victims. We are victims.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <em>sin is something that we do</em>. We are the perpetrators: we pull the trigger, we bend the truth, two options are presented and we choose the morally inferior one. Sinners are blameworthy and we haven't wanted to take the blame since back in the garden.</p>
<p>I'm still not sure what the difference between fallenness and brokenness is but I am pretty confident about the difference between brokenness and sin. And the reason that the worship leader keeps talking about brokenness at the beginning of the service and we keep praying about it in prayer meetings is the same reason that the sermon series on Joel never accused me of being a sinner. I don't like taking the blame.</p>
<blockquote><p>Brokenness reframes sin turning us into victims<br />
rather than perpetrators</p></blockquote>
<p>Don't misunderstand me. There <em>are</em> broken things and we <em>are</em> broken people. Not every bad thing that happened to you is the result of your own sin. And yet, the reason that I live in a sinful world is as much about me as it is about anyone else. Maybe in a generation that has such apathy to obedience and holiness, it's time to own up to the part we play in breaking our world.</p>
