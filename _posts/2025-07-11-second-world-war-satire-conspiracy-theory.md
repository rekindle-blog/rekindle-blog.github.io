If you grew up in South Africa, then there’s a good chance you were indoctrinated—just like I was. Sitting through history class in the early 2000s it never occurred to me that what Mr van der Bergh taught as fact was nothing more than a fabrication, an elaborate ruse. To my shame I thoughtlessly gobbled up his nonsense, never stopping to do my own research and uncover the truth. Instead I sat in darkness, for years; finally I’ve seen the light (Matthew 4:16). I now know that the Second World War never happened.

'What changed?' you ask. Well, I went onto YouTube and started doing my own research. In less than a week I realised I knew better than 99% of our so-called historians and academics. But I’m not naive. I did more than watch 30 or so hours of completely unregulated YouTube content; I was sure to test my research by listening to other experts, both on the History Channel and Reddit. Unsurprisingly, when I visited my local library they told me there isn’t a single book in print that denies the events of the Second World War. Fortunately I was able to watch hundreds of peer-reviewed shorts on social media demonstrating the opposite. All of this confirmed my growing suspicions: a global conspiracy to make people believe in the Second World War.

I’m writing this article so that other prisoners might be set free, so that the blind receive sight (Luke 4:18). Though there are countless foolproof arguments that prove there was no such thing as the Second World War, I’ve selected the three that I found most compelling. It’s my hope that you’ll objectively weigh the evidence yourself, instead of continuing in your delusion and indoctrination.

### Incontrovertibly Disproving the Second World War

The first thing I realised, pretty quickly too, is that you simply can’t trust anyone who insists there was Second World War. Put another way, anyone who believes there was a global conflict between 1939 and 1945 is compromised. Whether they’re historians, eyewitnesses, or veterans, the sad reality is they’re all committed to perpetuating the myth. As WinstonRumourmill45pointed out in one of his rigorously researched YouTube videos, "they want you to believe it happened even though they all know it didn’t. They are deceiving you. All of them." Thus anyone who believes in the Second World War is either actively engaged in the deceit or they haven’t done their own historical digging. Which are you?

Secondly, last week in a TikTok publication, DDAYforDECEIT pointed out that none of the wartards insisting on conventional, mainline history were even there. None of them have even seen a 'world war.' All they know is what the system has taught them, what their error-strewn and suspiciously similar histories recount. How can we believe in something we haven’t witnessed with our own eyes, something we’ve merely been told? No one does that. It’s unconscionably naive. Furthermore, just last week nazisfornoobs1939 shared interviews with people who lived throughout the time of this supposed global conflict. Yet none one of them recalled seeing any soldiers—or even hearing a single shot fired.

Finally, whenever I hear sheeple citing the hundreds of hours of film documenting the Second World War I chortle, because we all know that footage can be faked. Hello? AI. Photoshop. Microsoft Paint. If you watch BBC’s *Band of Brothers* closely you’ll actually notice in the opening credits that the story was not only "directed" but also "written." I mean, they’re not even hiding it anymore. We all know the war was staged, any video evidence to the contrary was obviously filmed on a large set in the French countryside. WinstonRumourmill45 actually visited France a few years and saw those sets with his own eyes. Naturally all of the evidence he uploaded to YouTube were fact-checked and shadow banned, while Hollywood continues to pump out war films unabated.

### Who Are You Going to Trust?

A lot of you have raised questions about the credibility of the reels I’ve been sharing on Instagram. To all of you, I’d ask some searching questions: who are you going to believe, someone with a PhD in history from Cambridge or someone with an iPhone and an internet connection? Do you seriously trust your high school history teachers, when nazisfornoobs1939 has repeatedly shown that they’re complicit in the global conspiracy? Have you forgotten that you also played 'war games' when you were young? Now set aside your childish ways and stop thinking like a child (1 Corinthians 13:11). 

#### A Note to the Reader

In case you missed it, this is a [satire](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2020-10-08-a-note-on-satire). The Second World War took place. In fact, I chose it as the subject of this satirical piece because I don’t imagine anyone would claim otherwise, making it an effective analogue for thinking about popular conspiracies—such as the moon landings being faked, the assassination of J. F. K., *The Da Vinci Code* and aliens being stored in Area 51.

The purpose for my satire was to briefly demonstrate how conspiracy theorists operate. Though they speak about evidence and proof, their real force is in the ability to harness people’s doubts and distrust. As Edward Feser [pointed](https://www.krusekronicle.com/kruse_kronicle/2006/09/we_the_sheeple_.html) out after the proliferation of 9/11 conspiracy theories, the primary mode of this thinking is little other than a “hostility to authority, tradition, and common sense.” Conspiracy theories are rarely constructive or intelligent, logical or cogent. Because they’re grounded in radical skepticism, not reason. Thus proponents of these theories don’t present their own position as much as they dismiss out of hand the credibility of their opponents—note: not their opponents’ arguments. And that is just one arrow in the quiver of logical fallacies you’ll encounter when you engage them.
