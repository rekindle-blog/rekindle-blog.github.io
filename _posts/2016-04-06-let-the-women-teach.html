<p>I am not a feminist in the modern use of the word but I reserve consistent views in the traditional pursuit for the equality of women. There is no doubt that we live in a man's world but the west is quickly changing our perceptions on what is acceptable as far as women's rights are concerned.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-2450 alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Mockingjay-coin-katniss-300x200.jpg" alt="Mockingjay-coin-katniss" width="300" height="200" />Consider the strong &amp; authoritative roles being depicted as women on the recent stage of teen sci-fi: Chancellor Ava Paige in the Maze Runner Trilogy; Katniss &amp; President Coin in The Hunger Games Saga; and the 3 leaders depicted in the Divergent novels, Beatrice, Jeanine and Evelyn. If those are too unfamiliar, consider the depiction of women in series like Bones, Castle and others: Dr Saroyan in Bones as the head of the forensic division; Victoria Bates in Castle as Captain of the 12<sup>th </sup>Precinct. We are subtly or perhaps not so subtly, being taught about the equality of women.</p>
<p>Coming to the discussion as a reformed evangelical, I believe what most reformed evangelicals would teach; that is, that the role of pastor and elder is reserved for men. In our society, where we feel an overwhelming pressure for equality, we like to explain that these positions are not a matter of equality but of calling and function. The man functioning as pastor is not 'better' than the women functioning as Sunday school teacher; they are equally performing their respective roles. Just as the pen and paper cannot do the others job they work best performing the part that they were designed to play.</p>
<p>But this post is not purposed to persuade you on the above matters. However, if you are persuaded I am glad. This post is primarily presented to those who already believe this model for gender participation; to those who teach it and affirm it strongly, not only negatively by prohibition (“<em>I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man.</em>” 1 Timothy 2:12), but also positively affirming the many excellent and note-worthy tasks that women <em>are </em>called to (“<em>Teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live… to teach what is good. <strong><sup> </sup></strong>Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God</em>.” Titus 2:3-5). If this is what you teach at your church then please read on.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2451" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Rekindle-FB-Blog-women-teach-1-300x251.jpg" alt="Rekindle FB Blog - women teach (1)" width="300" height="251" />Why, for the love of honour and integrity, do you ask men to speak at a women's event/bible study? If these men are such excellent teachers then by all means, ask them to preach on Sunday so all can benefit. Why, in the only context for a woman to teach an expository, well-reasoned, adult-appropriate message, do you invite a man? You cannot continue to positively affirm the teaching role of women to other women without actually allowing it to happen. Do you believe women to be so weak, naive and emotionally unstable that they are incapable of teaching other women adequately? Or do you have such little confidence in them since they have not been discipled or fed enough meat? Let the women teach.</p>
<p>And why, for the love of Christ's exposure of the excessive Pharisaic laws, do you create 'laws' in your churches about what could possibly, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered teaching/holding authority. If a woman should stand up at the beginning of a service, welcome the congregation and pray, and be perceived by a handful as authoritative, will you make a rule to protect the more important rule? And if a woman should say anything ‘spiritual’ when leading the church in song and be perceived by a handful as authoritative, will you make a rule to protect the more important rule? And if a woman should write anything pertaining to the Word, and be perceived by the reader as authoritative, will you make a rule and stop reading?</p>
<p>Perhaps I have gone too far. Please don't misunderstand my point. I simply long to see a women’s spiritual contribution taken seriously in the church. If you affirm that women are equal to men (“<em>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</em>” Galatians 3:28) and that women are given tremendous gifts from God to be used for the edification of the body (“<em>To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.</em>” 1 Corinthians 12:7), then please do not win our favour in theory only to disregard these principles in practice. The point is not to permit all things for women but to take decisive action on what you already affirm. Women should not be pushing that all can equally use their gifts in the church; it is the leadership role of godly men. That is your mandate. Please play your role well, so that we can play ours.</p>
