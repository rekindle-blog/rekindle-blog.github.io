<p>We have written about evil, darkness, and sin at Rekindle, but last week I encountered first hand an evil that both broke my heart and enraged me. A friend in our church who is facing a far from optimistic cancer prognosis was urged to pray using Jesus' name and his own authority as a believer <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/the-folly-of-word-of-faith/">(see previous post)</a>. This increasingly popular teaching says that God does not want us to ask for things according to his will, rather we must use the power of Jesus’ name to rid our lives of sickness and whatever else ails us. In other words, “You’re sick because you do not have enough faith or because you haven’t prayed using a specific formula.” Quite frankly, to say that to a Christian – with faith and the fruits that evince it – is not merely unloving; it is wicked. It is evil. In this post I will highlight a small selection of the innumerable biblical responses to this false teaching.</p>
<h3><strong>Jesus’ faith</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/lukes-innocent-jesus-a-point-from-repetition/jesus-prayer-09/" rel="attachment wp-att-1034"><img class="alignright wp-image-1034 " src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/jesus-prayer-09-300x225.jpg" alt="Jesus at Mount of Olives" width="341" height="256" /></a>I touched on this in my previous post. But it is too important to skip over. When you state, “Don’t pray: your will be done,” because it is too submissive and weak, remember that that is exactly how Jesus prayed (Matthew 26:39). So you must either rebuke the Son of God or desist from your folly. When Peter calls on Christians to follow Christ’s example in his first epistle we should note that he remembers Jesus’ suffering, death, <em>and</em> that he trusted the Father without wavering (1 Peter 2:13-25). Jesus’ faith is not shown in him demanding a better reality from his Father but in <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/what-easter-teaches-us-about-prayer/">submitting to the Father despite unanswered prayers</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Jesus’ teaching</strong></h3>
<p>Following on from the previous point, we turn to the <em>manner</em> in which Jesus taught his disciples to pray: “Your will be done” (Matthew 6:10). Correct: the very phrase scorned by those in the word of faith movement is one Jesus encouraged his disciples to use. I am astounded that Jesus got it so wrong. I guess if he had taught his disciples to pray properly they might have avoided persecution and martyrdom. Silly Jesus. If only the apostle John had access to the teaching of Andrew Wommack or Benny Hinn he could have avoided being exiled to Patmos (Revelation 1:9). Choose today whom you will follow.</p>
<h3><strong>Paul’s suffering</strong></h3>
<p>Since we are on the topic of Jesus’ apostles, I shudder to think about how paltry Paul’s prayer life must have been: imprisoned (Ephesians 3:1); abandoned by his friends, left alone and cold (2 Timothy 4:9-18); shipwrecked (Acts 27:39-44); and unable to pray away the thorn in his side (2 Corinthians 12:7-10). In fact, just read 2 Corinthians 11:16-12:10. For in the first century the Lord certainly chose weak vessels, akin to jars of clay, which showed the power of the gospel and gave all glory to God. Luckily for us today we have super-apostles who boast much greater ministries than the embarrassment that was Paul’s. If only a copy of Joel Osteen’s <em>I Declare </em>was mixed in with the parchments he requested from Troas.</p>
<h3><strong>Prayer is made into a mantra</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/the-wickedness-of-word-of-faith/candles-1901047_960_720/" rel="attachment wp-att-2742"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2742" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/candles-1901047_960_720-300x202.jpg" alt="Candles" width="335" height="226" /></a>Returning to the my introduction, telling someone that God has not answered their prayer because they failed to append “I claim this in the name of Jesus,” is highly problematic. Firstly, notwithstanding what I have written above, it reduces God to a parent withholding something from their child because they have not said the magic word. Imagine God saying to his child, “I would have healed your cancer, if only you had asked me properly.” Secondly, it also reduces God to a vending machine: put in the right amount and click the right buttons and you will be blessed. The power of prayer is reduced to <em>how</em> we ask and not <em>who</em> we are asking: our heavenly Father. I do believe that God invites us to <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/prayer-resigned-and-stubborn/">boldly approach him in prayer</a>, but to claim that our wording or specific invocations will force God’s hand is witchcraft, blasphemous, and self-deifying. God hates these things.</p>
<h3><strong>The inevitability of death</strong></h3>
<p>Lastly, though much more could and must be said against this alarmingly popular heresy, we turn to the matter of death. Markus Zusak’s <em>The Book Thief</em> opens with, “You are going to die,” and he is right. For we read of only a few names in the Bible who did not, and they are marked exceptions. Two years ago Jan Crouch, the co-founder of TBN, died during TBN’s healing month. To add satire to irony, The Babylon Bee wrote, “Baffled prosperity gospel preachers have begun offering theories Tuesday on how Crouch could possibly have passed away, given her overabundance of faith, her supernatural ability to name and claim health and wealth at will, and her decades of collecting donations while promising that God’s will is for everybody to be wealthy and healthy.” Why, if we have inherited all of this power, and need only claim wellness or chide sickness, do we succumb to it in death? Because the word of faith movement is a lie; an evil lie that robs people of faith.</p>
<p>Admittedly I wrote this post while emotional and incensed, though I do not think the heat is without light. The word of faith movement is wicked not because it promises things that God does not. It is wicked because when the things it promises do not materialise faith itself is brought into question. Telling someone that God wants them well when they are dying could be the difference between them persevering in the faith and falling away because their mantras have failed them. So I want to address any readers who have said the sorts of things critiqued in this post. If you speak these wicked words you need to repent. You need to humble yourself before the God of mercies and turn from this evil. And you need to pray for those people you have deceived.</p>
