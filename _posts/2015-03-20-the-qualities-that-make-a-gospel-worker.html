<p>Many readers will likely know that if I can get the funds I need I will be doing a MA Theology (technically in Biblical Studies) in the States. One of my scholarship applications (which was rejected, read into that what you will) posed the question, "What qualities make someone a good minister of the Gospel and why?" I really enjoyed thinking through the answer to this question. Here is something of what I wrote - what would you say?</p>
<h2>Love</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2110" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/love.jpg" alt="Love" width="284" height="177" />When asked, "What qualities make someone a good minister of the Gospel?" I immediately think the answer must be whatever characterised Jesus. Jesus not only ministered the gospel, he is the gospel. Love is probably the simplest answer at which to arrive but is undoubtedly undermined by the flippancy with which we say it. For Jesus, it meant self-giving sacrifice in the extreme, I think of 1 John 4 and Romans 5. I don't think we can begin to fathom the depths of what love means.</p>
<p>The answer seems associated with the greatest commandments, to love God and our neighbours. Certainly a good minister of the gospel must love God above everything he could ever dream of. It's difficult to measure someone's love for God though, but it can often be seen in his/her love for others. It does seem like a bit of a cheat to say "love" though, it's too general, too abstract. What does love look like?</p>
<h3>Love seen in Humility.</h3>
<p>Philippians 2 was the first passage that occurred to me and humility the first attribute. I suspect that's because whenever I believe I have humility, I find it is like quicksilver in my hands. Even so, pride and arrogance in the ministry never turn the focus to God but to the minister and that is always worthless. Jesus exemplified humility and "[our] attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus".</p>
<h3>Love seen in Service.</h3>
<p>Closely related to humility is service. I pick service because it is something identifiable in a person. Again, Philippians 2 characterises Jesus as a servant and it is in service that we see Jesus' self-sacrificial love at work. If we love people as ministers of the gospel, it will be a delight to serve them even when serving them is unpleasant because ultimately we are serving Christ.</p>
<h2>Holiness</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2108" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/holiness.jpg" alt="Holiness" width="251" height="201" />Perhaps holiness should precede love. In any case, it is loving holiness and holy love that characterised Jesus and that should characterise a minister of the gospel. Of course the gospel is for the sick but it's not the gospel if it never heals them. An indication that the gospel is at work in anyone's life is a growth in holiness. Holiness, therefore, must be present in the life of a gospel minister. This is what Paul means when he looks for a man "blameless" or "above reproach" in Titus 1 and 1 Timothy 3.</p>
<h2>Prayer</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2109" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/prayer.png" alt="Prayer" width="182" height="277" /> Prayer doesn't really fall under holiness or love and yet it is tied to both because it is a matter of relationship just as holiness and love are. I could be wrong, but the only thing I recall the disciples asking Jesus to teach them is how to pray (Luke 11). Apparently disciples recognise the need to pray. It is also instructive to read Paul's epistles and note how his prayers pervade his discourse. Prayer strikes me as a hallmark of a relationship with God.</p>
<p>Of course, Paul enumerates a number of other qualities. What qualities would you say make a someone a good minister of the gospel? What are the qualities you would look for?</p>
