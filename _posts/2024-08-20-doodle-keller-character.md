Earlier this year I worked on an article for TGC Africa that was eventually titled ['What Would Keller Do?**'**](https://africa.thegospelcoalition.org/article/what-would-keller-do-missional-ministry/) For my millennials readers and older, that title will very likely tug at your memories, having lived through the phenomenon of WWJD wristbands. Looking online it appears that the church didn’t keep up with the times, because colourful silicon wristbands are still trendy—somewhere. And because [virtue signalling](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2021-11-24-virtue-signal-consumerism-controversy) is alive and well you can order one in support of just about any cause. Then, as was the case with most of us donning our WWJD bands, you can feel good about yourself. No further action required. But that’s the end of my long meandering introduction, bringing us closer to the point of this doodle: discussing the Keller article I’d suggested we title it ‘WWKD’, with an image to match.

WWKD? It’s a great question. As John Koning argues: "Keller is gold; read and listen to him. But to stop there would be to miss the point." In other words, while reading Keller is personally enriching, it’s unlikely he would have been satisfied with us merely discussing his ideas about ministry. Thus John goes on to exhort Christians to become better exegetes of the culture, so that they might engage with it winsomely instead of withdrawing fearfully—a good Neo-Calvinist instinct. I heartily recommend John’s article, and not only because I work for TGC Africa. As he write: "subscribing to all that Keller taught should have [radical implications](https://africa.thegospelcoalition.org/article/keller-the-great-commission-demands-church-planting/) for our ministry." However, being about halfway through Collin Hansen’s Timothy Keller biography, I’m realising that WWKD—just like WWJD—could quickly become a crushing burden.

Timothy Keller was an exceptionally gifted man; Hansen’s biography makes that clear. Yes, countless people were influential and formative throughout his life—from Barbara Boyd to Edmund Clowney—but the raw material was brimming with brilliant potential. Keller’s capacity was tremendous; as was his commitment to thinking. His reading was not only wide and incredibly deep—from philosophy to sociology, history to fiction, all the while keeping current with the news. Then there was his preaching and training, along with his remarkable ability to answer questions. Again, by recounting this I’m not denying that he benefitted abundantly from others—perhaps no one more than Kathy—yet he was himself exceptional in most ways. But you’re not. Nor am I.

This means any ambitions to imitate Keller’s ministry, writing, preaching, cultural engagement or leadership can easily turn into profound discouragement. Reading Hansen’s biography I’ve repeatedly imagined myself taking up Keller's mantel, so to speak. I mean, which pastor or theologian doesn’t long to do what Keller did? He planted a church in Manhattan, the first new church building in over four decades. Over the next three decades that church grow to become one of the biggest in the state. Speaking of New York, Keller appeared on the Time’s bestseller numerous times. And I could go on.

To be frank, accomplishing anything remotely like what Keller did is probably beyond you and me—even if we teamed up. Imitating him will be impossible. So perhaps we should hit pause on the production of those WWKD bands. In their place, I propose WWKB: 'Who Would Keller Be?' The reason I wrote this doodle is to say that I do believe we can become like Keller, all of us.

Page after page of Hansen’s biography I’ve been struck by Timothy Keller’s character. Yes, his output was incredible. Only by all accounts, he was a humble man. For all his genius he was also gentle and kind, patient and irenical. He combined a firm faithfulness with generous love. Keller embodied many if not all the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23).

And it’s at this point that imitating Keller is perhaps within our reach. After all, Paul called on believers to imitate him as he imitated Christ (1 Corinthians 11:1). I often reflect on that verse and wonder what Paul is referring to—somehow, I don’t imagine that it has anything to do with his ministry or church planting (2 Corinthians 11:23-29; see Acts 13). Paul speaks about himself imitating Christ, which pushes us towards understanding this as an appeal to character. If Paul believed it was possible for the hot mess at Corinth to imitate himself and so become more like Christ, surely the same can be said for us and Keller.

We have the same Spirit and Lord, the same Father in heaven (Ephesians 4:3-6). Therefore, "walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love" (Ephesians 4:1-2). Keller did that. You can too. By God's grace we can imitate him, following after him as he followed after Christ.
