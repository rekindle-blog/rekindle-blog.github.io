Earlier this year I wrote a [doodle](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2024-05-08-bavinck-theology) on Herman Bavinck’s expansive and inspiring vision for theological studies. In his words, from the *Reformed Dogmatics*, "Dogmatics is not a dull and arid science. It is a theodicy, a doxology to all God’s virtues and perfections, a hymn of adoration and thanksgiving, a 'glory to God in the highest.'" Put another way, theology is meant to fill us up to overflowing. It’s an exercise for [the heart](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2021-10-05-the-heart-is-deceitful-but-that-doesn-t-mean-feelings-are) and not only [the head](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2022-03-15-christian-theologian-101-intellectual-lust). This is why—more recently—the likes of Michael Horton and John Webster have said theological discipline that doesn’t end in doxology is deficient to the point of being incomplete.



For a bookish person such as myself, Bavinck’s vision stirs both "amen" and "woe is me" from my lips. I’m firmly convinced by it, but troubled as well. I read a lot of theology; I lecture it too. My work at TGC Africa involves editing theological pieces. I have nerdy friends who talk theology with me. If I’m honest, my life and mind is saturated with theological reading, reflection, and writing. But is my heart? To return to Bavinck’s vision: has the way I’ve gone about theological study become dull and arid? Or does the truth about God’s virtues and perfections evoke praise and thanksgiving? Have I traded in adoration for acumen? Does all this thinking redound in thanksgiving?

Theologians will at this point be quick to warn me against a false dichotomy—and I’m certainly not trying to force a strong distinction between theological studies and spiritual maturity. However we must also be alert to the danger of presumption. Here I’m not referring to [pride](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2022-02-16-christian-theologian-101-humility), but the more surreptitious threat of conflating Christian learning with Christian maturity. As Paul Tripp writes in his *[Dangerous Calling](https://www.paultripp.com/dangerous-calling;)*, "Since seminaries tend to academise the faith, making it a world of ideas to be mastered, it is quite easy for students \[and scholars] to buy into the belief that biblical maturity is about precision of theological knowledge and the completeness of their biblical literacy." Let’s not forget that the church at Ephesus was commended for its doctrinal purity (Revelation 2:2), and rebuked for its waning affections (Revelation 2:4).

But the title of this doodle indicated that it would be about Bavinck’s beautiful vision for the church, not theology. Please forgive the meander, though I promise it’s going to tie together. When I was an undergrad at theological college, our then principal David Seccombe used to say: 'a lot of people reckon the more technical your theology the less vital your faith. But those people are reading the wrong theology. Or reading the right theology wrongly.' I’m sure he put it better than that. Any way, I’d like to believe that I together with most of my readers are reading what Seccombe referred to as the right theology. Therefore when our theological depths aren’t matched by delight and affection, it’s probably because we’re reading poorly—without prayerful contemplation, humility or the desire for holiness and God’s glory.

To adapt something Augustine wrote in *On Christian Teaching*, true theology doesn’t only instruct or inform; it will also move us to obedience and stoke delight. And with that we come to Bavinck’s beautiful vision for the church. In one of his earlier theological essays—titled *The Christian Faith*—the Dutch theologian asks: who will honour God? And his answer is worth much reflection.

"Who will honour him? Once more the church raises its voice and declares, *I believe in one holy catholic Christian church*. The church is there and it will be completely despite the attacks and the gates of hell. Through the forgiveness of sins and the resurrection of the flesh, the church will certainly be restored to eternal life. There is no doubt about it. This is where all the works of the three divine persons are directed. One in essence, they are also one in purpose. The church is the temple they build together and desire for dwelling. And when the elements burn and the earth and its works perish, then this temple, which God has laboured for centuries will arise gloriously upon the ruins of sin and abide forever."
