Last week Gavin Ortlund released a superb [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cknkEYf1u4g&t=17s) on how to become better readers, with five strategies for reading more. Crucially he starts by saying, "There’s no real shortcuts to this. It’s hard work." Because of that, reading is in decline—and no, neither Instagram captions nor foreign films with subtitles count. I appreciate how Ortlund begins, because he doesn’t deny the need for discipline and discernment in becoming a better reader. In fact, as you’ll see from most of his points, reading well is a [cultivated habit](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2020-07-31-fridays-with-fred). At times it will be demanding. It should always be deliberate. Ortlund also avoids popular approaches to reading, which measure success by volume or information gleaned. Thus, I heartily recommend watching his video.

In this supplementary post, I will summarise each of Ortlund's five strategies, adding the occasional—or odd—comment of my own. Then I will suggest two more ways to becoming better readers.

## Gavin Ortlund's Strategies

1. **Read selectively**; good readers focus on quality. Like every market in today’s world, there are far more books than we have time for. And only a small percentage of those are actually worth our time. But being spoilt for choice shouldn’t result in mindless consumerism. As Ortlund says, good reading majors in works that are outstanding or seminal, celebrated and significant.
2. **Read sporadically**; Ortlund’s second point has been made often. Always have a book with you and capitalise on short windows for reading. But this isn’t only a practical way to resist the infinite scroll. Studies suggest that we actually retain more from shorter reading stints, as well as before and after reading breaks.
3. **Read strategically**; contrast with more spontaneous and sporadic reading (above), here Ortlund makes the case for cultivating reading time in your schedule. That is, we must plan to read. If possible, we should reserve the time in the day when we are freshest and most focused. Unsurprisingly, key to this strategy is putting away the black mirror.
4. **Read systematically**; becoming a better reader will require some kind of method. This will include taking notes, highlighting or underlining, marginalia, and making summaries. In short, Ortlund exhorts against being a [passive reader](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2023-12-06-escapism-literature). Good readers engage with their subject matter. They consider how it connects with other reading, learning and the rest of life.
5. **Read spontaneously**; Ortlund’s fifth point in some ways cuts against the rest and calls on aspiring readers to, well, read. Pick up a book. Start with what you love or topics that interest you. Follow your curiosities so that you’re personally invested in what you read. Don’t wait until you’ve drafted the perfect approach. Make a start. Today.

## Two Necessities: Worthwhile Books and Wonder

Undergirding these points are two principles or themes, both of which Ortlund makes explicit. These are also worth some reflection.

The first is that good reading depends on a high quality of literature and personal engagement with it. To be plain, not all books are created equal. Many are written to be sold. Sadly, we often confuse the "bestseller" with 'best book' on the topic. But that’s rarely the case. If you desire to become a better read you must comb the shelves and read critically.

Ortlund’s second theme is to beware making reading into a burden. As he puts it, we must aim at enjoyment, though we also mustn’t conflate that with [escapism](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2023-12-06-escapism-literature). Certain written works will demand perseverance, but your reading shouldn’t be a joyless march with gritted teeth. More isn’t better (Ecclesiastes 12:12). Nor is toiling for the sake of ticking books off some conceited list you found online. A good reader will love the journey, delighting in the discipline and developing through it.

## Two Supplementary Points

Ortlund admits that, being so short, his video is not an attempt at being comprehensive. Furthermore, it’s become a fairly unimaginative cottage industry to identify the deficiencies of listicles and practical advice online. Therefore my two supplements below aren’t offered in spite of Ortlund, but rather in the same spirit that longs to see better reading undertaken and treasured in our age. I hope some readers will also appreciate my taking up of Ortlund’s alliterative mantel.

#### 6. Read Stories

Firstly, or sixthly, Ortlund doesn’t get into describing the different types of literature that make for good reading. But I wouldn’t be surprised if most people concluded that fiction isn’t party to it. As I’ve [argued](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2022-06-09-reading-fiction) with the help of C. S. Lewis, "fiction is a deep well, from which we can draw much truth." Too often people associate fiction with recreation and non-fiction with value-adding reading. This is a misnomer. Learning isn’t limited to information. Formation isn’t only achieved through propositions. Fiction helps us to feel the truth.

#### 7. Read Side-by-Side

Finally, though Ortlund concludes his video with exhortation to use writing as a way to serve others (1 Corinthians 8:2-3), he doesn’t speak to enriching experience of [reading in community](https://rekindle.co.za/content/2021-10-14-the-power-of-story-to-form-community-reading-together). I meet with a few friends every other Monday night to discuss a novel we’ve all read and I always have my understanding and grasp of the story expanded through those conversations. The same is true when I’ve met with friends to discuss a particular work of theology or topic. In the Western world reading has increasingly become an isolated exercise, when it should be enjoyed with others.
