<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/four-god-given-uses-for-the-bible/bible-276067_640/" rel="attachment wp-att-2982"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2982" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bible-276067_640-300x220.jpg" alt="Devotional" width="348" height="255" /></a>I recently taught 2 Timothy 3:10-17, on two separate occasions, and found myself stirred by this familiar passage. While studying at college it was a favourite to cite among both students and lecturers concerning the doctrine of Scripture. Without going into any of that I want to unpack the four ‘uses’ of Scripture mentioned by Paul in 3:16, and how we might employ them in our own Bible reading. Paul writes “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable [or useful] for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness”. Below I will make brief comment on each of those and then suggest how they might inform your response to God’s Word, whatever passage you are reading.</p>
<h3><b>Teaching truth</b></h3>
<p>Firstly, the Bible is given to teach us, to inform our thinking and positively shape our doctrine. Since Scripture is given to us by God - which is at least one of the important implications of it being breathed out by him - we should allow it to build our theology. Too often we treat our Bible reading the same way we do motivational quotes; or, worse, the sum total of our Bible reading is cherry-picked and inspiring verses suited to fridge magnets but unable to inform our beliefs. God gave us the Bible to shape our minds and reveal himself to us. So the next time you are meditating on a passage of Scripture, one of the questions to ask is this: what can I learn from God and about him, what is he teaching me?</p>
<h3><b>Challenging error</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/four-god-given-uses-for-the-bible/2756494307_a0380a96e0_m/" rel="attachment wp-att-2981"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2981" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2756494307_a0380a96e0_m.jpg" alt="Correcting error" width="337" height="223" /></a>Secondly, and with a little more difficulty, we are told that the Bible reproves. The Greek word used here, along with the next, is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>, which simply means this is the only place it occurs in the New Testament. After you have finished impressing your friends with your newfound linguistic jargon, note that this is significant because it makes the specific sense of the word elusive. Technical discussions aside, commentators and translators seem to agree that it carries the idea of challenging false doctrine or beliefs. This would make it the negative side of our first use. While the Bible is profitable for building up true theology it also tears down wrong beliefs. So, applying this use to our reading of Scripture, we should ask: does this portion of the Bible challenge or correct erroneous ideas I hold?</p>
<h3><b>Correcting sin</b></h3>
<p>Thirdly, with the discussion above in mind, this word most likely refers to behaviour, making it the negative of the fourth use (below). The Bible is given to us by God not only to shape our minds and beliefs but also how we live, speak, work, rest and treat others. This is often done through teaching us truth. But since it is included in a list where that idea is already present we can assume Paul is speaking about morality or ethics—more simply, how a Christian honours Christ in all of life. God instructs us how to behave. When we listen to God’s Word it will result in repentance, putting off what God calls sin. For example, in James 2 we read, ‘Do not be partial’ (2:1). God calls out discrimination, on whatever grounds, and exhorts Christians to repent of racism and classicism, among other things. Thus, the next time you are reading your Bible, reflect on how God is challenging your behaviour, and allow his definition of sin to shape your life.</p>
<h3><b>Training in righteousness</b></h3>
<p>Finally, we are told that Scripture positively shapes our behaviour, training us in righteousness, creating people that please God. If the previous point moved us to ask what we should stop, then this word makes us ask: what should I start? Where is my Christian life, obedience, and love deficient? God does not only desire that we refrain from sin, hearing and accepting his correction, but calls us to practical and positive expression of our faith. I know for myself this is often the hardest application to make, not because we struggle to understand what God demands but because we do. God calls us to express our faith through righteous action.</p>
<h3><b>Four questions to ask in your Bible reading</b></h3>
<ol>
<li>How is my theology positively informed by this truth?</li>
<li>What errors in my theology are corrected by this passage?</li>
<li>What sins in my life does is God challenging?</li>
<li>How can I positively respond in obedience to God as a result of this text?</li>
</ol>
