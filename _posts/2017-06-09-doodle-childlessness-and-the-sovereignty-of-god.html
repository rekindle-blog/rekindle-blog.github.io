<p>I have now written a couple of posts arguing against the position of many Christians that says married couples must at least attempt to have children. Most recently I challenged what I believe are <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/unconvincing-arguments-for-why-married-couples-must-have-children/">weak arguments against deliberate childlessness</a>, developing <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/responding-to-challies-is-it-okay-to-deliberately-not-have-children/">another post</a> I wrote on the topic last year. This shorter post is a personal note, appended to those linked above. And I am writing it because though I stand by my position, my wife and I recently had a child; in fact, we knew my wife was pregnant when my first post went up. So here, very briefly, I want to answer some of the pointed criticisms and more emotional reactions to my posts.</p>
<h3><strong>God is sovereign</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/doodle-childlessness-and-the-sovereignty-of-god/41epgewrf-l-_sx304_bo1204203200_/" rel="attachment wp-att-2703"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2703" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/41ePGeWrF-L._SX304_BO1204203200_-184x300.jpg" alt="Institutes volume 1" width="184" height="300" /></a>One comment on my original post read, “You aren't the one who decides if you have kids or not. You may do your best to prevent it, but if the Lord wants you to procreate you are going to have kids.” AJ, who posted the comment, could not have been more correct. We had decided that we did not want children, but God willed something else. I am reading through Calvin’s <em>Institutes</em> this year and it was certainly no coincidence that I read this the day before my son was born, “Augustine rightly complains that wrong is done to God when a higher cause of things than his will is demanded” (1.14.1). Calvin also writes that we must accept God’s secret purposes. Though that section addresses speculation, it applies well to sovereignty. Later, Calvin writes, “If we had quiet and composed minds ready to learn, the final outcome would show that God always has the best reason for his plan (1.17.1).</p>
<h3><strong>Children are a gift</strong></h3>
<p>Since God is sovereign it follows that children are the result of him giving them to us. They are not something everyone is entitled to, nor are they something every married couple should expect (or demand) from God. This is surely part of the reason children are called a blessing throughout the Old Testament. My wife and I are very grateful for our son. Our experience of him has been serendipitous, an unlooked for delight. But because children are a gift, a blessing from the Lord, all of us must remember what the Puritan <a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/samuel-rutherford-on-divine-providence/">Samuel Rutherford</a> wrote in one of his letters, “I write my blessing to that sweet child, whom you have borrowed from God; he is not heritage to you, but a loan, love him as folks do borrowed things.” We are not entitled to children, as Rutherford says they are not our heritage but borrowed from God. We are entrusted with children, to treasure and take care of them.</p>
<h3><strong>How to we respond to God’s sovereignty and gifts?</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.rekindle.co.za/content/doodle-childlessness-and-the-sovereignty-of-god/image1/" rel="attachment wp-att-2704"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2704" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image1.jpg" alt="Theodore Lewis" width="242" height="323" /></a>This is the question all of us must answer, and not only when God gives or withholds children. At another point in his <em>Institutes </em>(1.16.6), Calvin shows that the scope of God’s sovereignty is ubiquitous, “Nothing at all in the world is undertaken without his determination.” This, Calvin says, means that discontentment with our lot is nothing other than the attempt to rid ourselves of God’s purposes. AJ’s comment on my post touched on this, “Hopefully if your wife does get pregnant the child is not aborted. Surely a pastor would not do that.” I would want to add that no Christian would do that. But the point as I conclude is the question: how do we respond to God’s sovereignty, and the gifts he does or does not give us? One of the names we were considering for our son was Felix, which is Latin for lucky or fortuitous. The name we settled on was Theodore, ‘gift of God.’</p>
