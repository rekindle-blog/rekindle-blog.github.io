<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2946" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Idea-generation-page-300x201.jpg" alt="Idea generation page" width="300" height="201" />This is the last in a series of posts on church metrics. We’re going to close off this series with some how-to tips.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that <strong>a metric is any quantifiable measure, any piece of data, which is linked to a goal. The closer a set of measures identifies how we are doing in relation to the goal, the more effective it is as a metric</strong>. For example, if you play cricket and want to be a great batsman, you would measure your strike rate and batting average.</p>
<p>It’s a bit tricky to nail down what this would look like in any given situation, because life is incredibly colourful. That said, below is a set of questions to ask yourself. These will hopefully take you some of the way toward developing your own set of metrics that help you get to where you believe God wants you to be.</p>
<p><strong><em>How would our ideal situation look and feel?</em> </strong>Paint a vivid picture of where you want to be, in your mind or on paper.</p>
<p><strong><em>What are some key ideals?</em></strong> From your vision of the future, list some key concrete aspects which can be measured (e.g. amounts, quality, characteristics, purchases, etc). Measure those.</p>
<p><strong><em>How does our current situation look and feel?</em></strong> Like the above, consider the current status quo. Pay special attention to the differences between the future and the present.</p>
<p><strong><em>What are the key differences to overcome to get to our future state?</em> </strong>Your answer to this question may help you identify further important concrete aspects of the future which you can measure.</p>
<p><strong><em>What impacts my list of concrete measures?</em></strong> Identify, with your team, as much of the funnel of inputs and outputs which have a bearing on your metrics above as possible. From that funnel, select the aspects which have the most significant impact, and track those.</p>
<p><strong><em>How could people potentially manipulate these measures? </em></strong>If you can see a way to ‘game the system’, include measures to help avoid that.</p>
<p><strong><em>What actions can I take to move towards that future state?</em> </strong>Identify the actions you can take to influence the key changes that need to take place. Put these in your diary and stick them on your wall. Bear in mind that these may change, so use your metrics as your conversation partner, and constantly adjust.</p>
<p>And that’s that. Our series on metrics has come to an end. My hope is that it will contribute in some way toward us being more faithful in our service to the Lord who has commissioned us.</p>
