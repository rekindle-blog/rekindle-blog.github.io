excerpt: I'm not sure what it is that makes poetry powerful but somehow magnificence is
  magnified by rhyme and rhythm, poetry is to literature what High Definition
  Rendering is to photography. This is a poem by John Newton entitled "Day of
  judgment! Day of wonders!". Just the first line is awesome but how about, "See
  the Judge, our nature wearing, clothed in majesty divine."

<p><strong>Day of judgment! Day of wonders!</strong><br />
1 Day of judgment! Day of wonders!<br />
Hark! the trumpet's awesome sound,<br />
louder than a thousand thunders,<br />
shakes the vast creation round.<br />
How the summons<br />
will the sinner's heart confound!</p>
<p>2 See the Judge, our nature wearing,<br />
clothed in majesty divine.<br />
You who long for his appearing<br />
then shall say, "This God is mine!"<br />
Gracious Savior,<br />
own me on that day as thine.</p>
<p>3 At his call the dead awaken,<br />
rise to life from earth and sea.<br />
All the powers of nature, shaken<br />
by his looks, prepare to flee.<br />
Careless sinner,<br />
what will then become of thee?</p>
<p>4 But to those who have confessed,<br />
loved, and served the Lord below,<br />
he will say, "Come near, you blessed,<br />
see the kingdom I bestow;<br />
you forever<br />
shall my love and glory know."</p>
