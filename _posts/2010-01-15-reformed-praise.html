excerpt: "I've just discovered a new website - perhaps others are more familiar with
  it... I find that often my love for reformed theology is at a loss when it
  comes to music because there are very few artists who produce consistently
  good songs (both musically and lyrically). Sovereign Grace Music is one
  notable exception as I have enjoyed much of their music.\r

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rplogo-small.gif" />I've just discovered a new website - perhaps others are more familiar with it... I find that often my love for reformed theology is at a loss when it comes to music because there are very few artists who produce consistently good songs (both musically and lyrically). <a href="http://www.sovereigngracemusic.org/" rel="nofollow">Sovereign Grace Music</a> is one notable exception as I have enjoyed much of their music.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.reformedpraise.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.reformedpraise.org</a> is the site I am talking about. Their featured song is <a href="http://www.reformedpraise.org/songs/modernhymns/the-gospel-of-grace/" rel="nofollow">"The Gospel of Grace"</a> - really cool!</p>
